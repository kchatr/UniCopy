Field of the Invention  \\n       [0002] This invention relates to support garments and in particular to multifunction support garments used for back support, lower torso (abdominal) support or chest compression.  \\n       [0003] 2. Background Art  \\n       [0004] Post-operative care, athletic injury, or anatomical weakness have created a demand for various types of support garments.  \\n       [0005] Illustrative of the prior art is U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,122 which issued to Edward H. Yewer, Jr. on Jan. 7, 1997. That reference discloses a convertible support belt. However, the garment disclosed by that reference is limited to use around the waist and can only be adjusted by detaching and reattaching one elastic strap in a circumferential direction. Accordingly, there remain problems associated with difficulties in adjustment and versatility of use.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0006] The present invention includes a support garment which has multiple adjustment bands that allow varying degrees of compression and can be adjusted vertically or horizontally to allow additional degrees of freedom. The invention is also versatile and can be used for back or abdominal support or chest compression.  \\n       [0007] It is a principal object of the present invention to provide varying degrees of compression to targeted areas.  \\n       [0008] It is another object of the invention to provide a system which can be adjusted vertically and horizontally to allow an additional degree of freedom.  \\n       [0009] The invention has a central portion including an inner surface which is adapted to engage other members. The central portion is inelastic and the inner surface is soft. An elastic swath connects the right and left sides of the central portion to create a continuous encircling band.  \\n       [0010] Adjustment members connect to the outer surface of the elastic swath and are arranged in a row. The adjustment members exert pressure on the elastic swath portion and can be extended longitudinally or laterally. Each adjustment member has an attachment means at its end which attaches to the outer surface of the central portion of the garment.  \\n       [0011] In an alternative embodiment, adjustment members include means for accommodating ice packs. Such means could include a pouch, pocket, a semi-resistant ledge attached to the inside of the adjustment band and the like.  \\n       [0012] The multifunction support garment can be used to target the hips, waist, ribs, stomach or chest. The firm central portion of the garment can be placed on the back, front or sides to target compression to any area of the torso. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0013]FIG. 1 is an elevation side view of the multifunction support garment showing the free ends of the adjustment members unattached;  \\n     [0014]FIG. 2 is an elevation side view of the multifunction support garment showing the free ends of the adjustment members deployed in an attached configuration; and  \\n     [0015]FIG. 3 is a near perspective view of the multifunction support garment.  \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)  \\n     [0016] With reference to FIGS.  1 - 3 , a central portion  10  of a multifunction support garment includes an inner surface  26  and an outer surface which is adapted to engage other members. An elastic swath  12  connects the right and left sides of the central portion to create a continuous encircling band. Adjustment members  14  connect to the outer surface of the elastic swath.  \\n     [0017] The central portion  10  is comprised of an inelastic material. The central portion of  10  has a first  16  and second edge  18  (FIG. 2) and the elastic swath  12  has a right  20  and left  22  end (FIG. 1).  \\n     [0018] The multifunction support garment is configured to provide a versatile article of clothing that allows varying degrees of compression and can be adjusted vertically and horizontally.  \\n     [0019] In use, the adjustment members  14 , preferably of which there are 3, each have a central portion that is affixed to the elastic swath  12 . Each adjustment member  14  has a free end  24  that is detachably attached to the first  16  or second  18  edge of the central portion  10 .  \\n     [0020] As depicted in FIG. 1, the adjustment members are attached in a row proximate the middle of the elastic swath. In use, the adjustment members exert a pressure upon the elastic swath portion when attached thereto.  \\n     [0021] If desired, one or more of the adjustment members may include means for accommodating other accouterments such as ice packs, heating pads and the like.  \\n     [0022] In use, each of the 3 adjustment bands has the capability of extending longitudinally or laterally (circumferentially) to allow additional degrees of freedom of choice so that pressure can be localized to a desired part of the anatomy.  \\n     [0023] It will be appreciated that the means by which the free end of each adjustment member can be attached to the central portion can include, without limitation, attachment means such as VELCRO\\u00ae, buttons, press studs, adhesive tape, and the like.  \\n     [0024] When the central portion is placed on the wearer&#39;s back, the multi-function support garment effectively provides support to that area of the anatomy. When the central portion is placed in front, the multi-function support garment effectively supports the lower torso (abdomen) or, if desired, the upper torso (chest) if placed thereabout.  \\n     [0025] One attribute of the elastic swath is that it does not crease or fold when placed in situ and is readily compliant with the anatomical shape of the wearer.  \\n     [0026] While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004115188-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"This invention relates to enzymes with proteolytic activity, to DNA constructs that code for said enzymes, to methods for production of said enzymes, to compositions containing said enzymes and to the use of said enzymes and enzymatic preparations for the degradation or modification of materials that contain peptide bonds.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"We claim:  \\n     \\n         1 .

This group of enzymes is characterised by its ubiquitous distribution in different life forms, its variability in the cell localisation and by its involvement in a large variety of physiological processes.  \\n       [0006] Depending on their mode of action, peptidases are classified as exopeptidases [peptidases that require the presence of an amino or free carboxyl terminal in the substrate], and endopeptidases [peptidases that hydrolyse peptide bonds present in the chain]. The different catalytic mechanisms recognised for these enzymes have given rise to four subgroups named according to the active site that intervenes directly in the rupture of the peptide bond [aspartyl-endopeptidases, cysteine-endopeptidases, metallo-endopeptidases and serine-endopeptidases]. A review of the classification and characteristics of these enzymes can be found in the work of Rawlings and Barret [Rawlings N. D. &amp; Barrett A. J. (1994). Families of serine peptidases. Methods in Enzymology, 244:19-61; Rawlings N. D. &amp; Barrett A. J. (1994). Families of cysteine peptidases. Methods in Enzymology, 244:461-486; Rawlings N. D. &amp; Barrett A. J. (1995). Families of aspartic peptidases, and those of unknown catalytic mechanism. Methods in Enzymology, 248:105-120; Rawlings N. D. &amp; Barrett A. J. (1995). Evolutionary families of metallopeptidases. Methods in Enzymology, 248:183-228). The peptidases can be acidic, basic or neutral, depending on their activity at low, high or neutral pH, respectively.  \\n       [0007] Peptidases are widely used in different industries, for example, in the manufacture of detergents for washing clothes, in the leather industry, in the food industry, etc.  \\n       [0008] Although the fungi of the genus Trichoderma have been under study for a long time (both because of their cellulolytic activity and because of their action as antagonists to fungal pathogens of plants) and numerous enzymes have been identified (chitinases, \\u03b2-1,3- and \\u03b2-1,6-glucanases, \\u03b1-1,3-glucanases, etc.), only two proteases have been identified and characterised: an aspartyl-protease of  T. reesei  and a serine protease of  T. harzianum.  The latter one is denominated Prb1, has been related to mycoparasitism, has a molecular weight of 31 kDa, a basic isoelectric point (Ip) and belongs to the subtilisins family (Geremia, R. A., Goldman, G. H., Jacobs, D., Ardiles, W., Vila, S. B., van Motagu, M. and Herrera-Estrella, A. (1993). Molecular characterization of the proteinase-encoding gene, prb1, related to mycoparasitism by  Trichoderma harzianum.  Molecular Microbiology 83: 603-613).  \\n       [0009] Although numerous enzymes have been described with proteolytic activity, their importance in industry along with the enormous variety present in terms of mechanism of action, affinity for substrate, specificity, lytic capacity, etc., justify the need to extend the arsenal of proteolytic enzymes available.  \\n       BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0010] The invention addresses the problem of providing new enzymes with proteolytic activity.  \\n       [0011] The solution provided by this invention is based on a new enzyme discovered by the inventors which has proteolytic activity, an acid Ip and belongs to the family of serine peptidases. A characteristic that said enzyme presents, in addition to its proteolytic activity that allows it to degrade peptide bonds, is its affinity for structures that comprise proteins or peptides, such as cell walls of fungi (which contain chitin and glucan polymers embedded in, and covalently bound to, a protein matrix), or structures comprising polysaccharides covalently bound to proteins, for example, cuticles of insects, arachnids, etc., whereby said enzyme may intervene in the degradation or modification of said structures comprising proteins or peptides. In addition, the enzyme provided by the invention can also be used in the irreversible proteolytic deactivation of structural proteins or with enzymatic activity determining the virulence or pathogenesis of pathogens on animals or plants.  \\n       [0012] Therefore, an object of this invention constitutes an enzyme with proteolytic activity. The process for obtaining said enzyme and compositions comprising said enzyme also constitute additional objects of this invention.  \\n       [0013] Additional objects of this invention constitute the use of said enzymes or compositions for the degradation or modification of materials containing peptide bonds, including structures comprising proteins or peptides, as well as irreversible proteolytic deactivation of structural proteins or those with enzymatic activity determining the virulence or pathogenesis of pathogens on animals or plants.  \\n       [0014] Another additional object of this invention constitutes the isolation and characterisation of DNA sequences that encode said enzyme and the cloning of said DNA sequences. The vectors, cells and transgenic plants comprising said DNA sequences constitute another additional object of this invention. The use of said DNA sequences for obtaining said enzymes or for the construction of transgenic plants also constitutes an additional object of this invention.  \\n       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0015] The invention provides an enzyme with proteolytic activity, hereinafter the enzyme of the invention, which has a sequence of amino acids selected from:  \\n       [0016] a) a sequence of amino acids comprising the sequence of amino acids shown in SEQ. ID. No.: 1, and  \\n       [0017] b) a sequence of amino acids substantially homologous and functionally equivalent to the sequence of amino acids shown in SEQ. ID. NO.: 1.  \\n       [0018] In the sense used in this description, the expression \\u201csubstantially homologous\\u201d means that the sequences of amino acids in question have a degree of identity, at the amino acid level, of at least 70%, preferably of at least 85%, and more preferably of at least 95%.  \\n       [0019] Similarly, in the sense used in this description, the expression \\u201cfuinctionally equivalent\\u201d means that the protein in question has at least proteolytic activity.  \\n       [0020] The enzyme of the invention, in addition to its proteolytic activity, which can be assayed both in gel, by means of the casein-SDS-PAGE assay [Example 1.2] and in liquid phase [Section A of Example 3.3], can also have affinity for structures that comprise proteins or peptides, for example, the cell walls of fungi, the cuticles of insects and arachnids, etc., and/or the capacity to irreversible deactivate, by means of proteolysis, structural proteins or those with enzymatic activity implicated in the attack of a pathogen on animals or plants. The affinity of the enzyme of the invention for structures that comprise proteins or peptides can be assayed by means of an adsorption-digestion process with purified cell walls of a fungus, for example,  C. acutatum  or  Botrytis cinerea,  as described in Example 1.3, where an assay to determine the adsorption of proteins to fungal cell walls is illustrated.  \\n       [0021] In a particular embodiment, the enzyme of the invention has the sequence of amino acids shown in SEQ. ID. NO.: 1 or an active fragment thereof, that is, a fragment of said protein that maintains its proteolytic activity.  \\n       [0022] In another particular embodiment, the enzyme of the invention is an enzyme, or active fragment, derived from  T. harzianum,  which has the sequence of amino acids shown in SEQ. ID. NO.: 1, or a part thereof. In a specific embodiment, the enzyme of the invention is an enzyme derived from  T. harzianum  which has the sequence of amino acids shown in SEQ. ID. NO.: 1 and has been denominated Pra1 in this description [Examples 1 and 2].  \\n       [0023] The Pra1 enzyme has a molecular weight of 28 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE, an Ip of 4.7-4.9, an optimum pH of 7.5 (although it is more stable at acid pH), an optimum temperature comprised between 35\\u00b0 C. and 40\\u00b0 C. (pH 7.5), belongs to the family of serine peptidases, is a trypsin type peptidase since it presents the sequences of the amino terminal and of an internal peptide presenting a high degree of homology with other proteases of the trypsin type, it has specificity for N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA (a synthetic substrate specific for trypsin) but it does not have activity against other synthetic substrates for chymotrypsin or elastase [Example 3].  \\n       [0024] The enzyme of the invention can be obtained from a producing organism thereof, such as a fungus of the genus Trichoderma, by means of a process comprising the culture of the producing organism under conditions appropriate for the expression of said enzyme and, subsequently, recovering said enzyme. In a particular embodiment of this invention, the fungus used belongs to the species  Trichoderma harzianum,  specifically to the strain deposited in the Spanish Collection of Type Cultures (CECT) with the access number CECT 2413.  \\n       [0025] As mentioned in Example 1, the culture of producing organisms can be performed in two stages. In a first stage, the spores of the fungus are inoculated in a culture medium supplemented with glucose as a carbon source and, then, the mycelium is collected, washed and cultured in a suitable minimum medium supplemented with purified fungal cell walls, for example, of  Colletotrichum acutatum,  as the only carbon source for inducing enzymes with proteolytic activity.  \\n       [0026] The isolation and purification of the enzyme of the invention can be carried out by means of conventional techniques that comprise the separation of proteins produced by means of chromatofocussing and gel filtration of the concentrated fractions presenting greatest proteolytic activity [see Example 2]. The enzyme with purified proteolytic activity can be used for its characterisation (Example 3).  \\n       [0027] From the enzyme of the invention, it is possible to identify and isolate the DNA sequence that codes for said enzyme by means of a process comprising:  \\n       [0028] creating gene libraries of genomic DNA (gDNA) or copy DNA (cDNA) from organisms that produce the enzyme of the invention;  \\n       [0029] sequencing the amino terminal of the enzyme of the invention and of tryptic fragments thereof;  \\n       [0030] designing the appropriate oligonucleotides for amplifying, by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a region of the genomic clone of the organisms that produce the enzyme of the invention that serves for obtaining probes for scrutinising said gene libraries; and  \\n       [0031] analysing and selecting the positive clones.  \\n       [0032] All these stages are described in more detail in Example 4 where obtainment of a DNA sequence that codes for the Pra1 protease of  T. harzianum  is shown.  \\n       [0033] The gene library of cDNA can be obtained from total RNA of the organism that produces the enzyme of the invention following a standard protocol [Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987, Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chlorofom extraction. Anal. Biochem. 162:156-159] with slight modifications. In a particular embodiment, the organism that produces the enzyme of the invention is  T. harzianum  CECT 2413, which is cultured in a minimum medium with fungal cell walls as the only carbon source, isolating the messenger RNA (mRNA) by means of oligo(dT)cellulose affinity chromatography. Then, the cDNA is synthesised, for example, using a commercial kit, it binds to a suitable vector and is packaged in an appropriate host.  \\n       [0034] The sequencing of the amino terminal of the enzyme of the invention and the internal fragments thereof can be carried out by any conventional process, for example, by means of the Edmans Matsudaira method [A practical guide to protein and peptide purification for microsequencing. Academic press, Inc. New York, Edmans Matsudaira (eds.) 1989].  \\n       [0035] From the information obtained from the amino terminal sequence and the internal fragments of the enzyme of the invention, a set of oligonucleotides can be designed for amplifying a specific sequence corresponding to the DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention. In a particular embodiment, the direct oligonucleotide was designed from the sequence of the amino terminal of the Pra1 enzyme while the inverse oligonucleotide (antisense) was designed from the sequence of the internal fragment of the Pra1 enzyme. In Example 3, the sequences of the amino terminal and an internal fragment of the Pra1 enzyme that served for designing the oligonucleotides used for performing the PCR are described.  \\n       [0036] The suitable fragments resulting from the PCR amplification can be labelled and used as probes to scrutinise a gene library (of gDNA or cDNA) in order to isolate the clones of interest by means of in situ hybridisation.  \\n       [0037] Therefore, the invention provides a DNA construct that codes for the enzyme of the invention which comprises:  \\n       [0038] a) a DNA sequence comprising the SEQ. ID. NO.: 2; or  \\n       [0039] b) a DNA sequence analogous to the sequence defined in a) which  \\n       [0040] i) is substantially homologous to the DNA sequence defined in a); and/or  \\n       [0041] ii) codes for a polypeptide that is substantially homologous to the protein encoded by the DNA sequence defined in a).  \\n       [0042] In the sense used in this description, the term \\u201canalogous\\u201d aims to include any DNA sequence that codes for an enzyme with proteolytic activity that has the properties i)-ii) mentioned above. Typically, the sequence of analogous DNA:  \\n       [0043] can be isolated from any organism that produces the enzyme with proteolytic activity based on the DNA sequence shown in SEQ. ID. NO.: 2, or  \\n       [0044] is constructed on the basis of the DNA sequence shown in SEQ. ID. NO.: 2, for example, by means of introducing conservative substitutions of nucleotides, that is, that do not give rise to another sequence of amino acids of the protease encoded by said DNA sequence shown in SEQ. ID. No.: 2, but which corresponds to the use of codons of the host organism destined to the production of the enzyme, or else by means of introducing substitutions of nucleotides that give rise to a different sequence of amino acids and, therefore, possibly to a different protein structure that could give rise to a mutant protease with properties different to those of the native enzyme. Other examples of possible modifications include the insertion of one or more nucleotides into the sequence, the addition of one or more nucleotides at either of the termini of the sequence, or the deletion of one or more nucleotides at either terminal or in the interior part of the sequence. For example, the sequence of analogous DNA can be a subsequence of the DNA sequence shown in any of the sequences shown in SEQ. ID. No.: 2.  \\n       [0045] In general, the sequence of analogous DNA is substantially homologous to the DNA sequence that codes for an enzyme with proteolytic activity of the invention, for example, SEQ. ID. No.: 2, in other words, it presents a level of homology of nucleotides of at least, 70%, preferably at least 85%, or more preferably, at least 95% with respect to any of the aforementioned sequences.  \\n       [0046] In a particular embodiment, the DNA sequence provided by this invention has the sequence of nucleotides shown in SEQ. ID. No.: 2, or a fragment thereof that codes for a protein that maintains the proteolytic activity.  \\n       [0047] In another particular embodiment, the DNA sequence provided by this invention, or fragment that encodes a protein that maintains the proteolytic activity originates from  T. harzianum  and comprises the sequence of nucleotides shown in SEQ. ID. No.: 2, or a part thereof. In a preferred embodiment, said DNA sequence is derived from  T. harzianum,  has the sequence of nucleotides shown in SEQ. ID. No.: 2 and codes for the Pra1 protease of  T. harzianum.    \\n       [0048] The DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention may originate not only from  T. harzianum  but also from any other strain of Trichoderma or from any host organism transformed with said DNA sequence.  \\n       [0049] Alternatively, the DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention can be isolated by means of conventional techniques from the DNA of any organism, by means of the use of probes or oligonucleotides prepared from the information on the DNA sequence provided by this description, or by means of initiators (by PCR).  \\n       [0050] The DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention, or the construct containing it, can be inserted into an appropriate vector. Therefore, the invention also relates to a vector, such as an expression vector, comprising said DNA sequence, or a construct that contains it. The choice of vector will depend on the host cell in which it is to subsequently be introduced. By way of example, the vector where said DNA sequence is introduced can be a plasmid or a vector that, when it is introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the genome of said cells and replicates along with the chromosome (or chromosomes) in which it has been integrated.  \\n       [0051] In the vector provided by this invention, the DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention should be operatively connected to a promoter and to a terminating sequence. The promoter can be any DNA sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the chosen host cell and can be derived either from genes that code for the homologous or heterologous proteins of the host cells. The processes used to bind the DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention to the promoter and to the terminating sequence, respectively, and for inserting said construct into a vector are well known by those skilled in the art and have been described, for example, by Sambrook et al. [Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989].  \\n       [0052] The invention also provides a cell that comprises a DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention, or a DNA construct that contains said sequence or said vector mentioned above. The host cells that can be transformed with the DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention can be prokaryotic cells or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, such as cells of vegetable tissue or fungal cells, for example, yeast cells or cells of filamentous fungi. The transformation of these cells may be performed by means of conventional techniques, for example, by means of techniques that implicate the formation of protoplasts and the transformation thereof followed by the regeneration of the cell wall. The transformation of cells of vegetable tissue can be very interesting from several points of view, for example, for increasing the resistance to phytopathogenic fungi.  \\n       [0053] Because the enzyme of the invention, optionally, has the capacity to irreversibly deactivate, by means of proteolysis, structural proteins or those with enzymatic activity implicated in the attack of pathogens on animals or plants and/or which determine the virulence or pathogenesis of pathogens on animals or plants, the DNA construct provided by this invention, which encodes the enzyme of the invention, can be used to reduce the virulence or pathogenesis of pathogens on animals and plants, or for increasing the resistance of animals and plants to pathogens, for example, for increasing the resistance of plants to fungi of the genus Botrytis by means of deactivation of the structural protein(s) or enzyme(s) implicated in the attack of the pathogen on the plant. Accordingly, in a particular embodiment, the DNA construct provided by this invention is used in obtaining transgenic plants able to express the enzyme of the invention to improve the resistance to pathogens by means of irreversible deactivation of enzymes and proteins responsible for the attack on the plant. In order to obtain these transgenic plants, it is possible to proceed with conventional antisense mRNA techniques and/or overexpression (silently in one sense), or others, for example, using binary vectors or other vectors available for the different techniques of transformation of plants available at present.  \\n       [0054] Therefore, the invention also provides a transgenic cell of a plant that comprises a DNA construct of the invention that has a promoter, functional in said plant, operatively bound to a DNA construct of the invention, or to a fragment thereof.  \\n       [0055] A transgenic plant comprising, at least, one of said transgenic cells, constitutes an additional object of this invention. In a particular embodiment, said transgenic plant is a strawberry plant.  \\n       [0056] The invention also provides a method for the production of an enzyme of the invention, that comprises culturing a suitable host cell containing the DNA sequence that codes for the enzyme of the invention in conditions that allow the production of the enzyme and recovery of the enzyme from the culture medium.  \\n       [0057] The medium used for culturing the transformed host cells can be any medium suitable for culturing the host cells in question. The peptidase expressed can be, advantageously, secreted to the culture medium and can be recovered by means of a process as described in Example 2 or by any other conventional isolation process for proteins that comprises the separation of the cells from the culture medium, the precipitation of the proteins and the separation by means of chromatographic methods.  \\n       [0058] The invention also provides an enzymatic preparation comprising at least an enzyme with proteolytic activity of the invention. This enzymatic preparation is useful for the degradation or modification of materials containing peptide bonds, that is, materials that contain proteins, peptides or amino acid moieties bound by peptide bonds, such as cell walls of prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms, for example, fungal cell walls, as these cell walls contain chitin and/or glucan polymers embedded in, and covalently bonded to, a protein matrix, or cuticles of insects or arachnids that comprise structures based on polysaccharides covalently bound to proteins.  \\n       [0059] The enzymatic preparation provided by this invention may contain between 0.01% and 100% by weight of the enzyme with proteolytic activity of the invention.  \\n       [0060] In a particular embodiment, the enzymatic preparation provided by this invention is an enzymatic preparation of a single component and mostly contains an enzyme with proteolytic activity of the invention.  \\n       [0061] In another particular embodiment, the enzymatic preparation provided by this invention comprises multiple enzymatic activities, for example, different enzymatic activities required for the modification or degradation of microbial cell walls. By way of example, said enzymatic preparation may include lytic enzymes, in particular of microbial origin (fungal or bacterial), for example, derivatives of different species of the genera Trichoderma, Oerskovia, Arthrobacter, Rhizotocnia, Staphylococcus or Streptomyces. It can also contain one or more enzymes able to modify or degrade cell walls, for example, enzymes with cellulolytic, mananolytic, chitinolytic or proteolytic activity, such as cellulases, \\u03b2-(1,6)-glucanases, \\u03b2-(1,3)-glucanases, mananases, endo-o exo-chitinases, chitosanases, proteases, \\u03b1- or \\u03b2-manosidases, mutanases, etc. These enzymes may come from any producing organism thereof, such as different species of the genus Aspergillus or those mentioned above in relation with the lytic enzymes.  \\n       [0062] The enzymatic preparation of the invention can be prepared by conventional methods and can be present in liquid or solid form, for example, in the form of a granulate. The enzymatic preparation may contain additives, for example, stabilisers that prolong the stability thereof.  \\n       [0063] The enzyme with proteolytic activity provided by this invention can also have an affinity for fungal cell walls, or for cuticles of insects and arachnids, and so they may help in the degradation of fungal cell walls, for example, phytopathogenic fungi, such as  C. acutatum, B. cinerea,  etc., or in the degradation of cuticles of insects, arachnids, etc.  \\n       [0064] Therefore, the invention also provides an antifungal composition comprising at least an enzyme of the invention along with at least a fungicide, for example, a chemical fungicide. Any of those normally used can be used as a chemical fungicide, preferably, a chemical fungicide selected from the group formed by the chemical fungicides that affect the membrane, the chemical fungicides that affect the synthesis of the cell wall and mixtures thereof. Optionally, the antifungal composition of the invention may contain, in addition, at least a protein with activity of degradation of cell walls can be used, if desired, in the antifungal composition of the invention.  \\n       [0065] The antifungal composition of the invention, which may contain between 0.01% and 99.99% by weight of the enzyme of the invention, may be prepared by conventional methods and may be presented in liquid or solid form, for example, in the form of a granulate. The antifungal composition of the invention can also contain additives, for example, stabilisers in order to prolong the stability thereof.  \\n       [0066] Since the enzyme of the invention can be used to degrade or modify materials containing peptide bonds, for example, the proteins present in microbial cell walls, the enzyme of the invention can be used as a biofungicide against different nuisance organisms, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi (including the fungi that cause damage in cultures and the fungi that contaminate fruit before and after harvest), pathogenic fungi in animals (including pathogenic fungi in humans), fungi that contaminate food, surfaces and equipment, and, in general, any fungi that causes economic losses in any industrial, agricultural or livestock sector.  \\n       [0067] The enzyme of the invention can also be used for breaking or lysing the cell walls of different microorganisms to recovery products of interest produced by said microorganisms.  \\n       [0068] The enzymatic preparation of the invention can be designed at will with a composition specifically adapted for the cell wall to be broken or lysed. For example, if the cell wall to be broken contains a protein-manane complex and a glucan, the enzymatic preparation could contain, advantageously, a mixture of protease activities, mananase, chitinase and \\u03b2-glucanase, in order to efficiently break said cell wall.  \\n       [0069] Other applications of the enzyme of the invention include, by way of illustration, and not limiting, the extraction of mano-proteins from the outer layer of the cell walls of yeast; the production of protoplasts from yeasts or fungi; the preparation of extracts of yeasts and fungi; improvement in the operations of filtration in processes for the production of wines, grape musts and juices; the elaboration of wines with organoleptic properties altered by overexpression of the gene in the wine yeasts; the elaboration of compositions for cleaning teeth and dentures; the elaboration of compositions for cleaning contact lenses; the elimination of fungi on coatings; treatment of tissues, for example, the removal of excessive colorant in tissues; the elaboration of compositions for removing the dental plate; the elaboration of compositions for removing biofilms deposited on surfaces, for example, on the surface of a contact lens; the manufacture of detergents for washing clothes and/or dishes, etc.  \\n       [0070] The enzyme or enzymatic preparation or the antifungal composition provided by this invention can be used in the control of nuisance organisms, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi (including the fungi that cause damage in cultures and the fungi that contaminate fruit before and after the harvest), pathogenic fungi of animals (including pathogenic fungi in humans), fungi that contaminate food, surfaces and equipment, and, in general, any fungi that causes economic losses in any industrial, agricultural or livestock sector. In the sense used in this description, the term \\u201ccontrol\\u201d includes the reduction or paralysing of the growth and/or the germination that may result in the elimination of said nuisance organisms or in the reduction of damage caused thereby. Therefore, in a particular embodiment of this invention, said enzymatic preparations or antifungal compositions will be pharmaceutical compositions or compositions for application in the agricultural sector.  \\n       [0071] The enzyme, enzymatic preparation or antifungal composition of the invention can also be used for disinfesting, preventing and/or treating infection caused by pathogenic fungi of animals in livestock facilities, which can be infested by pathogenic fungi that grow and develop in substrates that are in contact with the animals, for example, the straw used in animal bedding, or in the stable conditions of the animals, where there is a risk that said animals are infested by such pathogens.  \\n       [0072] On the other hand, as is well known, at times, the test samples for analysis, for example, biological samples, food, etc., present contaminations due to fungi that make difficult or impede the analysis of said samples. The invention provides a solution to said problem consisting in the use of an enzyme, enzymatic preparation or antifungal composition of the invention to control the fungal contamination in said test samples for analysis by means of its application to said samples.  \\n       [0073] The antifungal composition of the invention can be used to control all types of nuisance fungi, such as those mentioned above, by means of the control mechanism known as integrated control.  \\n       [0074] The dosing of the enzymatic preparation and of the antifungal composition provided by this invention and their conditions of use can be determined on the basis of methods known in the art.  \\n       [0075] Other applications of the enzyme of the invention include its use to control pathogenesis due to insects, arachnids, etc., by means of the destruction or modification of their cuticles, as well as its use to reduce the virulence or pathogenesis of pathogens of animals or plants by means of irreversible proteolytic deactivation of structural proteins and/or enzymes implicated in the attack of said pathogens on animals and plants.  \\n       [0076] The following examples serve to illustrate the present invention and should not be considered as limiting the scope thereof. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     EXAMPLE 1  \\n     [0077] Production of Enzymes with Proteolytic Activity by  T. harzianum  CECT 2413 in Liquid Culture with Affinity for Fungal Cell Walls  \\n     [0078] 1.1 Culture conditions of  T. harzianum    \\n     [0079] Pre-cultures were made of  T. harzianum  CECT 2413 in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of minimum medium for Trichoderma (MM) (15 g NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 ml trace metals (FeSO 4 .7H 2 O 0.5 g, MnSO 4 .H 2 O 0.16 g, ZnSO 4 .H 2 O 0.14 g, CoCl 2  0.37 g, distilled H 2 O in sufficient quantity for (s.q.f.) 100 ml), 2% glucose as a carbon source. The pH of the medium was set to pH 5.5 with 10 M KOH and distilled water was added in s.q.f. 973.5 ml. Once the medium has been sterilised, 20 ml of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4  (250 mg/mL), 4.1 ml of CaCl 2  1 M and 2.4 ml of 1 M MgSO 4  were added. The flasks were inoculated with a final concentration of 10 6  spores/ml, and incubated at 200 rpm at 25\\u00b0 C. for 48 hours. Then, the mycelia were collected in sterile conditions by filtration through filter paper. They were washed with an abundant amount of 2% (w/v) MgCl 2  solution and with sterile water, and immediately used to inoculate new cultures.  \\n     [0080] 1.2 Assay of Proteolytic Activity in polyacrylamide Gels: Casein-SDS-PAGE  \\n     [0081] The detection of proteolytic activity in the culture filtrates of  T. harzianum  was performed after submitting the samples to SDS-PAGE with the substrate included in the gel. For this, the preparation of the gels was performed normally, but adding the casein substrate to the separation gel, specifically 600 \\u03bcl of renaturing buffer [Tris/HCl 50 mM pH 8.0, 1% (w/v) casein (Sigma), 2 mM ethylendiamine tetracetic acid (EDTA) and 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide]. The samples to be tested were prepared in loading buffer containing sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) as denaturing agent, but not the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol [Tris/HCl 0.25 M pH 6.8; 40% glycerol; 8% SDS and 0.05% bromophenol blue]. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4\\u2032IC to reduce the enzymatic activity during the run. Then, the gel was incubated in renaturing buffer at room temperature while stirring for 1 hour, with two changes of buffer. This step has the aim of eliminating the SDS contained in the gel and allowing renaturing of the enzymes. Then, the gel was incubated at 37\\u2032IC in sodium acetate 50 mM buffer for 6 hours to allow the proteases to act. After staining and destaining the gels, the proteolytic activity is visualised as an unstained zone over a dark blue background.  \\n     [0082] 1.3 Protein Adsorption Assay to Fungal Cell Walls  \\n     [0083] The affinity on fungal cell walls of enzymes with proteolytic activity secreted by  T. harzianum  CECT 2413 was assayed following a conventional adsorption-digestion method. To do this, 2 ml aliquots of the culture filtrates of  T. harzianum,  concentrated and dialysed, were incubated with stirring at 4\\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes with an equal volume of a suspension at 1% (w/v) of purified fungal cell walls. Then, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall model RC5-C centrifuge with an SS34 rotor for 10 minutes. The collected supernatants were incubated once more with new suspensions of cell walls twice more. Finally, the cell walls were pooled and washed three times with 5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer solution 70 mM pH 6.0 supplemented with 1 M NaCl. The proteins that had not adsorbed to the cell walls (which remained in the supernatants) were precipitated and dialysed. The cell walls with the proteins adsorbed were resuspended in 1 ml of sodium acetate buffer 50 mM pH 5.5 and incubated in Eppendorf tubes at 37\\u00b0 C. for 24 hours to allow the digestion of the cell walls and the release of the adsorbed proteins. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 5 minutes, the supernatant collected and dialysed against distilled water. The analysis of the proteases present in the different fractions was carried out by means of an assay of the activity in casein gel-SDS-PAGE [Example 1.2].  \\n     [0084] 1.4 Identification of Proteins with Proteolytic Activity  \\n     [0085] In order to identify proteins with proteolytic activity secreted by  T. harzianum  CECT 2413, pre-cultures of the fungus were performed in minimum mineral medium (MM) supplemented with 2% glucose as indicated in Example 1.1. Once the mycelium had grown, it was collected and transferred to an MM medium containing cell walls purified from  C. acutatum  (conditions of simulated mycoparasitism) or 2% glucose (conditions of repression by carbon source for other enzymes described) as the only carbon source.  \\n     [0086] The suspensions of cell walls of  C. acutatum  and  B. cinerea  were prepared from mycelium. The cells were broken in a mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen, and washed several times with 2M NaCl and then with distilled water, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 8,000 rpm in the Sorvall model RC5-C centrifuge with GSA rotor, and collecting the precipitate after each wash. Then, the cells obtained were collected by filtration in kitasate, frozen at \\u221280\\u00b0 C. and lyophilised for 12 hours in a Virtis Centry\\u2122 lyophiliser, keeping them at room temperature until use. The purification degree was determined by observing the absence of cytoplasmatic material and plasmatic membrane material with an optical microscope.  \\n     [0087] The culture filtrates of  T. harzianum  harvested after 9, 24 and 48 hours, concentrated and dialysed, were analysed by means of an assay of proteolytic activity in casein gel-SDS-PAGE  \\n     Example 1.2] \\n     [0088] From the cultures in presence of cell walls, a single band of activity was detected at a height below that expected for the protease Prb1 of 31 kDa described in  T. harzianum  by Geremia et al (Geremia, R. A., Goldman, G. H., Jacobs, D., Ardiles, W., Vila, S. B., van Motagu, M. and Herrera-Estrella, A. (1993). Molecular characterization of the proteinase-encoding gene, prb1, related to mycoparasitism by  Trichoderma harzianum . Molecular Microbiology 83: 603-613), and which became more intense with increased culture time. In the cultures kept for 24 or 48 hours, other zones of proteolytic activity were also observed that did not always appear to be well defined. From the culture filtrates with glucose as carbon source, no bands of activity were detected, except for a very weak band after 48 hours of culture.  \\n     [0089] Casein used as substrate in this type of assays of proteolytic activity is usually used for the detection, in principle, of all types of proteases; nonetheless in the detection of metallo-proteases the use of gelatine is recommended (Wang, K. K. W., 1999. Detection of proteolytic Enzymes using Protein substrates. In: Proteolytic Enzymes. Tools and Targest. Pages 49-62. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, NY). Assays by means of gelatine-SDS-PAGE of the previous supernatants did not reveal new bands of activity, and those already observed disappeared or appeared with less intensity.  \\n     [0090] In order to know the affinity for fungal cell walls of the enzymes with proteolytic activity produced by  T. harzianum  CECT 2413 following the protocol described in Example 1.4, 2 ml aliquots of supernatant of culture kept for 48 hours in the presence of cell walls were submitted to an adsorption-digestion process with cell walls purified from  C. acutatum  or from  Botrytis cinerea , as described in Example 1.3. In the fraction adsorbed at the cell walls of  C. acutatum  or of  B. cinerea  a single band of activity was detected, while the remaining isoenzymes remained exclusively in the fraction that had not adsorbed.  \\n     [0091] The affinity of said enzyme with proteolytic activity for the structure of the cell wall suggested that it could form part of the battery of enzymes implicated in mycoparasitism, and so it was purified and characterised.  \\n     EXAMPLE 2  \\n     [0092] Purification of an Enzyme of  T. harzianum  with Proteolytic Activity with Affinity to Fungal Cell Walls  \\n     [0093] The purification of enzymes with proteolytic activity obtained from the protocol described in Example 1 was performed from the culture filtrate of  T. harzianum  CECT 2413 kept for 48 hours in a MM medium with cell walls of  C. acutatum  as the carbon source. To do this, 2 ml of filtrate dialysed and concentrated 75 times were submitted to chromatofocussing to separate proteins on the basis of their isoelectric point. The elution profiles obtained show two peaks of proteolytic activity on azocasein, one eluted at basic pH, coinciding with the main protein peak, and another at acid pH. The isoenzyme that coincided in electrophoretic mobility with the band corresponding to the protease with affinity for the cell walls of fungi and which was the largest one of interest, was localised in this second peak by means of the assay of activity in the casein gel-SDS-PAGE (Example 1.2), which indicates that this was an acid protease with Ip of 4.7-4.9.  \\n     [0094] The fractions were mixed, concentrated in Centricon-10 (Amicon) and submitted to gel filtration chromatography. The fractions that presented greatest proteolytic activity were pooled and concentrated once more in Centricon-10. The subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE and casein-SDS-PAGE allowed the homogeneity of the preparation obtained to be checked, in which a single band of protein and proteolytic activity, respectively, were observed. The purified enzyme with proteolytic activity and acid Ip was denominated Pra1 and has been used for its characterisation.  \\n     EXAMPLE 3  \\n     [0095] Characterisation of the Pra1 Protease  \\n     [0096] 3.1 Molecular Weight  \\n     [0097] The molecular weight calculated after SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomasie blue was approximately 28.5 kDa [Laemmli, E. K. (1970). Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of bacteriophage T4. Nature 227: 6]. When the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the loading buffer, no changes were observed in the molecular weight, which indicates the lack of sub-units linked by disulphide bridges, at least, of different molecular weight.  \\n     [0098] 3.2 Microsequencing  \\n     [0099] The sequencing of peptides obtained from the purified protease Pra1 was performed with the double aim of comparing the sequences of amino acids with those contained in the databases and performing the design of degenerate oligonucleotides that would allow the gene that codes for Pra1 to be cloned.  \\n     [0100] The sequencing of the amino-terminal and of the internal peptides of Pra1 was performed by the sequencing service Eurosequence b.v. (Groningen, Holland). For each one of the sequences, 1 nmol of purified protein was used, and subsequently cut from the gel after SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomasie blue. Obtaining internal peptides was performed by enzymatic digestion of the protein with trypsin, and subsequent extraction and purification using RP-HPLC. The sequencing process was performed following the Edman degradation method in an automatic sequencer from Applied Biosystems model 494 connected in phase with an RP-HPLC apparatus for the identification of the released PTH-amino acids.  \\n     [0101] Table 1 shows the sequences obtained from the amino terminal and those of an internal peptide of Pra1. Both showed similarity with the sequences of amino acids of proteases such as trypsins (or trypsin like) mainly, kallikrein, or plasminogen activator. All these enzymes for part of the S1 family of the serine-peptidases whose representative enzyme is chymotrypsin and which consists of enzymes with endopeptidase activity.  \\n               TABLE 1                          Peptide sequences                                         Id.

ID. NO.: 1 which contains the complete putative sequence of amino acids of Pra1.  \\n     [0103] 3.3 Determination of the Type of Peptidase by Means of Specificity Assays for Substrates and Inhibition of the Proteolytic Activity  \\n     [0104] A. Assay of the proteolytic Activity in Liquid Phase.  \\n     [0105] The proteolytic activity of the enzyme can be assayed using azocasein as substrate. The reaction mixture consists of 250 \\u03bcl of sodium acetate buffer 100 mM pH 5.5 which contains the sample of enzyme, 125 \\u03bcl of 0.1% Brij 35 and 125 \\u03bcl of azocasein (Sigma). The reaction mixture is incubated at 30\\u00b0 C. for a period of time comprised between 1 and 3.5 hours. The reaction is stopped by adding 200 \\u03bcl of 10% TCA (trichloracetic acid), and the supernatant is measured at 366 nm. A unit of activity represents the hydrolysis of 1 \\u03bcg of azocasein per minute in the assay conditions.  \\n     [0106] B. Specificity for Substrates  \\n     [0107] The differences in specificity for the substrate are, in general, more useful in the characterisation and classification of exopeptidases. Nonetheless, the preferential catalytic activity for certain residues of amino acids of many endopeptidases is known (Powers Powers, J. C. and Kam, C. (1995) Peptide Thioster substrates for serine peptidases and metalloendopeptidases. In: Methods in Enzymology, 248. 3-18), and thus, by assays of activity on certain synthetic peptides, the nature thereof can be analysed.  \\n     [0108] Taking into account the information obtained in Example 3.2, the endopeptidase activity of Pra1 on 3 synthetic peptides (Sigma) is assayed with the amino and carboxyl terminals blocked, with allows the different types of activities to be differentiated within the S1 family of peptidases:  \\n     [0109] N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA (Arg-pNA) for trypsins,  \\n     [0110] N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA (Leu-pNA) for elastases, and  \\n     [0111] N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (Phe-pNA) for chymotrypsins/subtilisins (this latter belongs to the S8 family).  \\n     [0112] The enzymatic solution (75 ng) was prepared in 90 \\u03bcl of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer and preincubated for 5 minutes at 30\\u00b0 C. The reactions were initiated by addition of 10 \\u03bcl of preheated 10 mM substrate solution (prepared from 100 mM solutions in DMSO stored at \\u221220\\u00b0 C.). After 20 minutes of incubation, the reactions were stopped by addition of 50 \\u03bcl of 2% (v/v) acetic acid. Then, the absorbance of 100 \\u03bcl at 405 nm was measured in microtitre plates with 96 wells (Inmunoplate Maxisorp, NUNC) using a Titertek Multiskan Plus 311 A0 (Flow Laboratories) automatic reader, and the nmoles of p-nitroaniline (p-NA) released per minute were calculated. In parallel, enzyme blanks with no substrate and substrate without enzyme were also processed. The standard calibration line was constructed with solutions of para-nitroanaline (p-NA) (Sigma) at known concentrations (0-1.25 mM) prepared from an initial 5 mM solution. This solution was prepared by dissolving p-NA beforehand in a minimum volume of ethanol.  \\n     [0113] The lytic activity of Pra1 on the peptide Arg-pNA confirmed its endopeptidase identity, and in addition, showed the preference of this protease for an apolar residue (Arg) at the P 1  position, characteristic of trypsin type enzymes. The specific activity of Pra1 on this substrate was 94,800 U/mg in optimum conditions of activity (30\\u00b0 C. and pH 7.5). Values for K m , K cat , and K cat /K m  of 0.22 mM, 39.64 s \\u22121  and 180.18 mM \\u22121 s \\u22121  were calculated, respectively.  \\n     [0114] The determination of the kinetic parameters K m , K cat , and K cat /K m  was performed from the initial rates calculated in assays with different concentrations of substrate (0.05-2 mM). For this, the substrate was prepared in 0.99 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and preincubated at 30\\u00b0 C. Then the reaction was started by the addition of 10 \\u03bcl of the purified proteases Pra1 (2.5 ppm) preheated to the same temperature. The activity was monitored for 10 minutes in a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer at 405 nm kept at 30 C by a thermostatA unit of activity represented the release of one 1 nmol of p-NA per minute in the assay conditions. Solutions of enzymes without substrate, and substrate without enzyme were prepared as blanks. The standard calibration curve was constructed with solutions of p-NA (Sigma) at known concentrations (0-200 \\u03bcM), prepared as indicated above. The kinetic parameters were calculated from representations of double reciprocals or by Lineweaver-Burk (1/V vs 1/S).  \\n     [0115] No lytic activity of Pra1 on Leu-pNA or Phe-pNA was observed, which indicates the absence of elastase and chymotrypsin/subtilisin activity, respectively.  \\n     [0116] C. Inhibition of Proteolytic Activity  \\n     [0117] In order to determine the catalytic type to which Pra1 belongs, specific inhibitors were used of the different known catalytic mechanisms. The effect of said inhibitors on the activity of Pra1 was analysed by preincubating the enzymatic solution for 30 minutes at 30\\u00b0 C. in 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5 with said specific inhibitors of different known catalytic mechanisms:  \\n     [0118] 1 mM PMSF (100 mM initial solution in isopropanol),  \\n     [0119] 1 mM EDTA (100 mM initial solution in water),  \\n     [0120] 0.1 mM Pepstatin (10 mM initial solution in DMSO),  \\n     [0121] 1 mM Iodoacetamide (100 mM initial solution in water, prepared at the time of use).  \\n     [0122] In parallel to the enzymatic assay, controls were also performed in the presence of organic solvent in which the inhibitor was dissolved. The residual activity was determined by the percentage of activity in absence of inhibitor.  \\n     [0123] As might be expected for a serine-peptidase, the lytic activity of Pra1 was drastically inhibited in the presence of PMSF. This irreversible inhibitor can also act on cysteine-peptidases, however, the alkylating agent, iodoacetamide, specific inhibitor of these, showed a weak effect on the activity of Pra1. Using inhibitors such as pepstatin or EDTA, Pra1 also conserved more than 90% of its activity.  \\n     [0124] The results obtained allow the affirmation to be made that Pra1 is a serine-endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21). It was confirmed that Pra1 belongs to the SI family, and particularly, to the group of trypsin type enzymes (EC 3.4.21.4) by analysing the complete amino acid sequence of the protein.  \\n     [0125] 3.4 Effect of Temperature on the Activity and Stability of Pra1  \\n     [0126] In order to determine the optimum temperature for activity of Pra1, the enzymatic assay was performed over a range of temperatures comprised between 30\\u00b0 C. and 85\\u00b0 C. The effect of temperature on the stability of Pra1 was determined by preincubating the enzymatic solution in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 for 20 minutes at different temperatures (30-85\\u00b0 C.). The substrate used in these assays was the synthetic peptide N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA, specific for trypsins.  \\n     [0127] The effect of temperature on the activity of Pra1 proteases showed that its optimum temperature is close to 35\\u00b0 C. At 45\\u00b0 C., the activity dropped drastically to 16%, and above 55\\u00b0 C., no activity was detected. Given that at 30\\u00b0 C., Pra1 maintains 95% of its activity, and this temperature is close to the conditions in which Trichoderma is cultured, it was taken as the normal temperature for the assays of activity.  \\n     [0128] 3.5 Effect of pH on the Activity and Stability of Pra1  \\n     [0129] For the determination of the optimum pH for activity of Pra1, the assay was carried out in the following buffer systems: 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 3-5.5), 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6-7), and 100 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5-9). The effect of pH on the stability of Pra1 was determined by pre-incubating the enzymatic solution (750 ng) for 24 hours at 4\\u00b0 C. in 10 \\u03bcl of the aforementioned buffers. Then, aliquots of 10 \\u03bcl were taken for performing the assay in standard conditions.  \\n     [0130] The obtained results show that the optimum pH for activity of Pra1 is comprised between 7.0 and 8.0. The activity decreased rapidly when the assay was performed in buffers with pH greater than 8.5 or less than 6.5.  \\n     [0131] The assay of activity of Pra1 performed in optimum conditions (30\\u00b0 C. and pH 7.5) after preincubating the enzyme for 24 hours in buffers at different pH showed that Pra1 is more stable at acid pH. The activity decreased as the pH of preincubation increased, with a reduction of 40% at pH 7. No proteolytic activity was detected after preincubation at pH 9.  \\n     EXAMPLE 4  \\n     [0132] Cloning of a Sequence of cDNA that Codes for Pra1  \\n     [0133] The cloning of the gene that codes for the protease Pra1 of  T. harzianum  was performed from a gene library of cDNA representative of the population of mRNA molecules that are transcribed in  T. harzianum  CERT 2413 when it is cultured in conditions of simulated mycoparasitism (for 9 hours in the presence of fungal cell walls as the only source of carbon).  \\n     [0134] 4.1 Obtaining Total RNA of  T. harzianum.    \\n     [0135] The extraction of RNA is performed from 50 mg of mycelium of Trichoderma ground up in a mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The mycelium is transferred to 10 ml tubes, to which 4 ml of \\u201cARNol yellow\\u201d lysis solution are added [20 ml of solution D (4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate pH 7,0, 0.5% (w/v) sarcosyl, autoclave and add 2-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 0.7% (v/v)], 2 ml of 2 M sodium acetate and 20 ml of phenol acid]. The samples were homogenised by stirring in vortex and mixing with a micropipette. They were then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes and transferred to Eppendorf tubes in aliquots of 1 ml. 0.2 ml of chloroform were added to each tube, stirring in vortex for 15 seconds, and incubating at room temperature for 2-3 minutes. They were then centrifuged at 12,000 g and 4\\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. One volume of isopropyl alcohol was added to the supernatant collected, with subsequent incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow the precipitation of RNA. Then the RNA was collected by centrifuging at 12,000 g and 4\\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes and washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol stirring in vortex until the precipitate separates from the tube. It was centrifuged at 4,000 g and 4\\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. Then the ethanol was eliminated by inversion, and the precipitate allowed to dry in air and resuspended in 40 \\u03bcl of water. The RNA obtained was quantified by spectrophotometry and its integrity checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. It was stored at \\u221280\\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0136] From 1 mg of total RNA extracted from the mycelium grown in the aforementioned conditions, 7.8 \\u03bcg of mRNA were purified by affinity chromatography. The mRNA was used for assembling the gene library in the vector Uni-ZAP\\u00ae XR (Stratagene).  \\n     [0137] 4.2 Assembly and Manipulation of a Gene Library of cDNA of  T. harzianum  CECT 2413 in the Vector Uni-ZAP\\u00ae XR  \\n     [0138] The cloning system ZAP-cDNA\\u00ae Gigapack\\u00ae III Gold Cloning Kit designed by Stratagene (Ref. 200450) was used. The experimental procedure was performed mainly according to the instructions of the protocol provided by the commercial firm both for the assembly and for the manipulation of the gene library.  \\n     [0139] From the mRNA purified from 1 mg of total RNA, the processes of synthesis of the first and second chain of the cDNA were carried out, the filling of the terminals of the double-strand cDNA, the assembly thereof on the EcoRI adaptors, the phosphorylation of the terminals, and the digestion with the restriction endonuclease XhoI, using the reagents provided by the commercial company Stratagene, and following in detail the recommendations of the protocol attached, with the exception that the radioactive nucleotides were not incorporated for monitoring the process. The subsequent separation of the cDNA from the excess of adaptors was performed by gel filtration chromatography using columns provided by the supplier Pharmacia. Then 150 ng, approximately, of cDNA were bound to 1 \\u03bcg of DNA vector (pre-digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI/XhoI) in a recommended reaction volume of 5 \\u03bcl, of which 2 \\u03bcl were used for the final process of packaging of the DNA inside the phage particles following the indications of the supplier. The efficiency of the packaging was 4,9.10 6  recombinant phages/tg of vector, and the titre of the primary gene library was 4.10 6  plate forming units (pfU)/ml (2.10 6  en total), with only 0.3% of phages being non-recombinant. The primary gene library, resulting from the process described, was stored at 4\\u00b0 C. for a time of less than 1 month before amplification.  \\n     [0140] Given the instability of the primary gene libraries, it is necessary to amplify them despite the loss of representativity of the least abundant clones. The process was performed by infecting 600 \\u03bcl of  E. coli  XL1-Blue cells with volumes corresponding to 50,000 pfu (plate forming units) of the primary gene library. The infection mixture was incubated at 37\\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes to allow attack of the phages and then it was added to the tubes with 7 ml of NZY (bacterial culture medium appropriate for the growth of phages) with preheated covering at 48\\u00b0 C. The tubes were stirred in vortex and the content immediately spread on 15 cm Petri dishes with solid NZY medium. The plates were incubated at 37\\u00b0 C. until confluent lysis halos were observed. Then 10 ml of SM buffer [100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO 4 , 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% gelatine (w/v)] were added and it was incubated once more at 4\\u00b0 C. in a gentle rocking motion to allow diffusion of the bacteriophages to the buffer. After 12 hours, it was collected and the buffer of the different plates was mixed, washing each one of them with 2 ml of additional buffer. The mixture collected was shaken vigorously in the presence of 5% (v/v) chloroform, and incubated for 15 minutes and room temperature. After centrifuging at 500 g for 10 minutes, the supernatant with the bacteriophages free of cell remains was transferred to a glass recipient. At this moment, the cDNA gene library was ready to be used. It was titred and stored at 4\\u00b0 C. in the presence of 0.3% (v/v) chloroform, and also at \\u221280\\u00b0 C. in the presence of 7% DMSO. The amplification of I million pfu provided a gene library amplified 2.5\\u00d710 6  times, with a titre of 1.6.10 10  pfu/ml.  \\n     [0141] 4.3 Searching the Gene Library  \\n     [0142] A. Obtaining the Probe of Pra1  \\n     [0143] The search for the cDNA clone corresponding to the Pra1 protease in the amplified gene library was performed by hybridisation using a DNA probe obtained beforehand by PCR from the gene library of phagemids pBluescript SK(\\u2212) derived from the bulk scission of 20.10 6  pfu. Said gene library of phagemids pBluescript SK(\\u2212) had a titre of 3.3.10 6  phagemids/ml (66.10 6  in total).  \\n     [0144] In order to obtain said probe, a PCR was performed from the phagemid DNA extracted from a million bacterial clones, using the degenerate oligonucleotides as initiators:  \\n                              PPra1: 5\\u2032ACTGCIGC(G/T)TTIGGIGA(A/G)TT(T/C)CC-3\\u2032 (sense);   [SEQ. ID. NO.:3]           and               Pra1IA: 5\\u2032-GGGTCTAT(T/G)ATIGGICCICC-3\\u2032 (antisense)   [SEQ. ID. NO.:4]          \\n \\n     [0145] designed from the sequence of amino acids of the amino-terminal peptides and internal peptides, respectively, of the protease Pra1. The reaction mixture was prepared in a final volume of 25 \\u03bcl containing buffer of PCR 1X, prepared from 10\\u00d7 buffer, provided by the enzyme, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , dNTPs 200 \\u03bcM, 1.25 units of Taq polimerase (Ecotaq), 4 \\u03bcM of each initiator oligonucleotide, and approximately 10 ng of phagemid DNA. The amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturing cycle at 95\\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles at 95\\u00b0 C. (denaturing) for 1 minute, 55\\u00b0 C. (hybridisation of the initiators) for 1 minute and 72\\u00b0 C. (extension) for 1 minute, finishing with a final extension cycle at 72\\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. The amplified products were analysed by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel and the fragments of interest were extracted from the gel and subcloned in  E. coli  using the plasmid pGEM\\u00ae-T as a vector, for subsequent sequencing.  \\n     [0146] As a result of the reaction, an amplification product was repeatedly observed of approximately 550 pb which, once recovered from the gel, was subcloned into a vector pGEM\\u00ae-T (Promega). The sequencing of this fragment made it possible to check that it contained the sequences that encoded for the known peptides of Pra1, such that it is used as a probe to examine the gene library in the vector Uni-ZAP\\u00ae XR and isolate the complete cDNA of pra1.  \\n     [0147] B. Transfer of Bacteriophage DNA to Membranes  \\n     [0148] Petri dishes 15 cm in diameter were prepared with approximately 50,000 pfu from the gene library of amplified cDNA. Once the lysis halos had been obtained, the plates were allowed to cool so that the covering agar acquired greater thickness. A nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham) was placed over the agar surface avoiding bubbles. The membrane was left for 5 minutes to allow the transfer of phages, and it was marked asymmetrically with a needle to allow orientation when it came to recovering the clone or clones of interest from the plate. The membranes were carefully withdrawn from the plates (which were stored at 4\\u00b0 C.) and treated with Southern I denaturing solution for 2 minutes, followed by Southern II neutralisation solution for 5 minutes, and finally with SSC 2\\u00d7 buffer, prepared from SSC 20\\u00d7, for 5 minutes. These treatments were performed by depositing the membranes, with the side that was in contact with the phages upwards, over Whatman 3MM paper soaked in the corresponding solution. Then, the membranes were allowed to dry in air and the transferred DNA was covalently fixed to the membrane. Then, the membranes were incubated at 65\\u00b0 C. with constant stirring in hybridisation solution [SSPE 5\\u00d7 (SSPE 20\\u00d7: 3.6 M NaCl, 0.2 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM EDTA pH 7.7), Denhardt Solution 5\\u00d7 (Denhardt Solution 100\\u00d7: 2% BSA (w/v), 2% Ficol\\u2122 (w/v), 2% PVP (w/v)), 0.5% SDS (w/v)] for 2 hours. Then, the radioactively labelled DNA probe was added and the incubation continued for 12-18 hours. After this time, the probe was removed and the membrane washed with a wash solution [SSPE 2\\u00d7, 1% SDS (w/v)] at room temperature for 15 minutes, and then twice more at 65\\u00b0 C. Finally, the membranes were wrapped in a transparent plastic film to prevent them from drying, and exposed with amplifying screens for the detection of positive clones.  \\n     [0149] Of a total of 2\\u00d710 5  clones scrutinised, 3 bacteriophages were identified that showed positive hybridisation signal. These were isolated in two successive hybridisation rounds. Once they had been recovered as pBluescript SK(\\u2212) phagemids, the inserts of each one were released by digestion with the enzymes EcoRI/XhoI. The three clones showed an insert size close to 1 kb. From the sequence obtained from one of these clones (pSKPra1) the sequence of amino acids deduced was obtained. This sequence of amino acids contained the peptides (amino terminal and internal) sequenced from the purified Pra1 protease, confirming that cloned cDNA was the one that encoded for this protein.  \\n     [0150] 4.4 Analysis of the Sequence  \\n     [0151] The cloned cDNA presented a size of 954 pb, including the tail of polyA of the 3\\u2032 terminal, with a open reading pattern of 777 pb that encodes a protein of 258 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 25,784 Da. This deduced sequence of amino acids contains the peptides (amino-terminal and internal) sequenced from the purified Pra1 protease, confirming that cloned cDNA is the one that codes for this protein.  \\n     [0152] The known sequence of the amino-terminal peptide of Pra1 indicates that the mature protein starts at residue I 1 , which points to the deduction that Pra1 is synthesised as a precursor with an extension at the amino-terminal end of 29 amino acids. The molecular weight calculated from the sequence of the mature protein (I 1 -G 228 ) is 25,023 Da, slightly less than that determined by SDS-PAGE from purified Pra1 protein (this divergence between the theoretical weight and the determined weight seems to be due to possible post-translational changes, such as glycosydations).  \\n     [0153] On the other hand, the isoelectric point estimated from the sequence of mature protein is 4.91, coinciding with that observed by preparative isoelectrofocussing (4.7-4.9).  \\n     [0154] On analysing the sequence of the amino-terminal region by means of the SignalP V1.1 program, a cut-off point was determined between the amino acids G \\u221210 -A \\u22129 , suggesting the existence of a peptide signal constituted from the first 20 amino acids, characteristic of secreted proteins. The 9 amino acids existing between the peptide signal and the mature protein would correspond to the pro-peptide characteristic of many proteases, which in the case of the serine-peptidases of the S1 family varies from 6-9 amino acids, and which, once processed, give rise to a new amino-acid terminal that generally starts with a hydrophobic residue such as valine, methionine, leucine or isoleucine, which is in agreement with the isoleucine residue presented by Pra1.  \\n     [0155] Comparison of the complete sequence of amino acids of Pra1 with those contained in the data banks (EMLB and Swiss Prot) showed the high degree of similarity of this protein with members of the S1 family of serine-peptidases such as trypsins and trypsin type proteins of rat, pig, etc. The maximum homology (75-80%) with identities equal to or less than 50% was presented with trypsin type proteins of filamentous fungi (Metharrizium, Fusarium). The sequences of fungal proteases with which they were compared were as follows:  \\n                                                       EMBL/Swiss Prot           Fungi   identification number                            Cochliobolus carbonum     Q00344             Fusarium oxysporum     P35049             Metharrizium anisopliae     Q9Y7A9             Metharrizium anisopliae     Q9Y842             Phaeosphaeria nodurum     074696                      \\n \\n     [0156] The alignment with these sequences allowed the catalytic triad (H-D-S) characteristic of the S1 family to be recognised as well as the different families that form part of the PA clan, and which were putatively assigned to the H 70  D 118  and S213 residues of the sequence deduced from Pra1.  \\n    \\n     \\n       \\n         1 \\n         \\n           \\n             4  \\n           \\n           \\n             1  \\n             258  \\n             PRT  \\n             Trichoderma harzianum  \\n           \\n            1 \\n\\nMet Ala Pro Val Leu Ala Ile Ala Ser Val Leu Ala Ala Leu Pro Ala \\n1               5                   10                  15 \\n\\nLeu Thr Met Gly Ala Ala Ile Thr Pro Arg Gly Ser Asp Ile Val Gly \\n            20                  25                  30 \\n\\nGly Thr Thr Ala Ala Leu Gly Glu Phe Pro Tyr Ile Val Ser Leu Ser \\n        35                  40                  45 \\n\\nThr Gly Gly Ser His Phe Cys Gly Gly Val Leu Ile Asp Ser Arg Thr \\n    50                  55                  60 \\n\\nVal Val Thr Ala Gly His Cys Thr Ile Asp Gln Arg Ala Ser Ser Val \\n65                  70                  75                  80 \\n\\nLys Val Arg Ala Gly Thr Leu Thr Trp Ala Ser Gly Gly Thr Gln Val \\n                85                  90                  95 \\n\\nGly Val Ser Ser Leu Thr Leu His Pro Ser Tyr Thr Val Asp Ser Gln \\n            100                 105                 110 \\n\\nGly Val Pro Asp Asn Asp Val Gly Val Trp His Leu Ala Thr Ala Ile \\n        115                 120                 125 \\n\\nPro Thr Ser Ser Thr Ile Gly Tyr Ala Thr Leu Pro Ala Ser Gly Ser \\n    130                 135                 140 \\n\\nAsp Pro Ala Ala Gly Thr Thr Leu Thr Val Ala Gly Trp Gly Thr Thr \\n145                 150                 155                 160 \\n\\nSer Glu Asn Ser Asn Ser Leu Pro Ser Thr Leu Arg Lys Val Ser Val \\n                165                 170                 175 \\n\\nPro Val Val Ala Arg Ala Thr Cys Asp Ser Asp Tyr Asp Gly Glu Ile \\n            180                 185                 190 \\n\\nSer Asn Asn Met Phe Cys Ala Ala Val Ala Ala Gly Gly Lys Asp Ser \\n        195                 200                 205 \\n\\nCys Ser Gly Asp Ser Gly Gly Pro Ile Ile Asp Pro Ser Gly Thr Leu \\n    210                 215                 220 \\n\\nVal Gly Val Val Ser Trp Gly Gln Gly Cys Ala Glu Arg Gly Phe Pro \\n225                 230                 235                 240 \\n\\nGly Val Tyr Thr Arg Leu Gly Asn Tyr Val Ser Phe Ile Asn Ser Asn \\n                245                 250                 255 \\n\\nArg Gly \\n\\n \\n           \\n             2  \\n             777  \\n             DNA  \\n             Trichoderma harzianum  \\n           \\n            2 \\n\\natggctcccg ttctcgccat cgcctccgtg cttgcagcac ttcccgctct caccatggga     60 \\n\\ngctgccatca ctcctcgtgg cagtgatatc gtcggaggaa ccactgctgc cctcggcgag    120 \\n\\nttcccctaca ttgtctctct gtccactggt ggttcgcact tctgcggtgg tgttctgatc    180 \\n\\ngactcccgca ccgttgtcac cgctggccac tgcaccattg accagagggc ctcctctgtc    240 \\n\\naaggtccgcg ctggaactct tacctgggct tccggtggca cccaggttgg tgtttcatct    300 \\n\\nctgacccttc accccagcta caccgtcgat agccagggtg ttcccgacaa cgatgttggt    360 \\n\\ngtttggcact tggccactgc cattcctacc agctctacca tcggttatgc tactcttcct    420 \\n\\ngcttctggct cagaccctgc tgccggtacc accctcaccg tcgctggctg gggaactact    480 \\n\\ntctgagaact ccaactctct cccctccacc ctgaggaagg tttccgtccc cgtcgttgcc    540 \\n\\ncgcgccactt gcgacagcga ctacgatggc gagatcagca acaacatgtt ctgcgctgct    600 \\n\\ngttgccgccg gtggcaagga ctcctgctct ggagactctg gtggccccat cattgacccc    660 \\n\\nagcggaaccc tggttggtgt tgtttcttgg ggtcagggat gcgctgaccg tggattcccc    720 \\n\\nggtgtttaca ctcgcctggg caactacgtc agcttcatca acagcaaccg tggttaa       777 \\n\\n \\n           \\n             3  \\n             23  \\n             DNA  \\n             Artificial Sequence  \\n             \\n               The artificial sequence is a degenerate \\n                         oligonucleotide as an initiator.

There have been many different configurations for infant rocking beds proposed in the prior art. However, none of these provide the slow, vertically bouncing motion. Another important feature of this vibrating infant bed is the incorporation of a timing switch to allow the device to operate automatically in a pre-selected period of time and eliminate the need for direct parent interaction.  \\n       [0003] In the related art, U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,097 issued in the name of Harper et al discloses an infant bouncer with handles.  \\n       [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 6,412,867B2 issued in the name of Robinson discloses an automatic two speed musical rocking chair which can rock back and forth to put a baby to sleep.  \\n       [0005] U.S. Pat. No. 4,982,997 issued in the name of Kroedler et al discloses an infant carrier which can provide a back and forth bouncing motion relative to the base position.  \\n       [0006] U.S. Pat. No. 5,490,711 issued in the name of Pollock discloses a musical rocking chair for a child without battery or electricity.  \\n       [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 6,415,912B1 issued in the name of Tamlin discloses a driving mechanism for shaking table.  \\n       [0008] Accordingly, there is a need for an infant bed having a simple design and which provides a slowly and smoothly vibrating motion in the vertical direction. In addition, there is a need for an infant bed including a timing switch to allow the device to operate automatically during a chosen period of time without parent interaction.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0009] The present invention provides a vibrating infant bed which comprises a top shell for receiving an infant, a vibrating mechanism for providing the vertically reciprocating motion to the shell, and a bottom shell for covering the vibrating mechanism. Located beneath the top shell, the vibrating mechanism is powered by an electric A.C. gear motor which is controlled by a timing switch and provides low rpm, high torque output. Holding an eccentric cam, the drive shaft is supported by two bearings and connected to the gear motor by a coupling. On top of the eccentric cam, a cam follower is kept in contact by springs and is mounted to a driving plate. The driving plate-cam follower assembly is guided to move in the vertical direction by bearings and vertical shafts. The rotation of the eccentric cam imparts the reciprocating motion in the vertical direction to the moving plate assembly.  \\n       [0010] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a vibrating infant bed that produces a slowly bouncing up and down motion.  \\n       [0011] It is another object of the present invention to provide a vertically reciprocating mechanism.  \\n       [0012] It is further another object of the present invention to provide a timing switch, a means to preset the operating time for the device.  \\n       [0013] It is still another object of the present invention to provide the soothing comfort of the slowly and vertically bouncing motion for babies to quickly and easily fall into sleep.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0014] The apparatus of the invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:  \\n     [0015]FIG. 1 is an unexploded perspective view of the vibrating infant bed of the present invention;  \\n     [0016]FIG. 2 is a partially exploded perspective view showing the shells and the vibrating mechanism of the invention;  \\n     [0017]FIG. 3 is the unexploded perspective view of the vibrating mechanism;  \\n     [0018]FIG. 4 is the partially exploded perspective view of the vibrating mechanism showing the motor-cam assembly and the moving plate assembly;  \\n     [0019]FIG. 5 is the top view of the vibrating mechanism;  \\n     [0020]FIG. 6 is the front view of the vibrating mechanism;  \\n     [0021]FIG. 7 is the end view of the vibrating mechanism;  \\n     [0022]FIG. 8 a  is the end view showing the cam-cam follower low position;  \\n     [0023]FIG. 8 b  is the end view showing the cam-cam follower high position;  \\n     [0024]FIG. 9 is the electrical schematic of the vibrating mechanism and timing switch;  \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n     [0025] Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a vibrating infant bed  10  is shown, according to the present invention, comprised of a vibrating mechanism  33 , a timing switch  31 , a top shell  32 , and a bottom shell  30 . Mounted on top of the vibrating mechanism  33 , the top shell  32  is the location where a baby can be placed and rocked to sleep. The bottom shell  30  provides a housing for the vibrating mechanism  33  and the timing switch  31 , which is used for controlling the operation time of the vibrating mechanism  33 . FIG. 9 shows the electrical schematic of the timing switch-drive motor control loop.  \\n     [0026] Referring to FIGS. 3, 4,  5 , and  6 , the vibrating mechanism  33  is powered by an electrical A.C. gear motor  15  which provides low rpm, high torque output. A coupling  14  connects the motor  15  to a drive shaft  12 . The drive shaft  15  is supported at both ends by two bearings  13 , which are mounted inside the base  16 . An eccentric cam  11  is mounted on the shaft  12  and located between two bearings  13 . Riding on top of the cam  11  is the moving plate assembly  20 , in which a cam follower  21  is mounted to a moving plate  22 . As seen in FIG. 7, the cam follower  21  is kept in contact with the cam  11  by two springs  19 . The moving plate  22  is guided to move in the vertical direction by bearings  23  and vertical shafts  17 , which are mounted to the base  16 . Springs  18  around shafts  17  are located between the moving plate  22  and the base  16  to counter-balance the load. As the motor  15  operates, the drive shaft  12  and the cam  11  rotate. The eccentricity of the cam  11  will cause the cam follower  21  and the moving plate  22  to move up and down as shown in FIGS. 7 a  and  7   b . Hence the rotation of the motor shaft imparts a reciprocating motion in the vertical direction to the moving plate assembly  20  and the top shell  32 .  \\n     [0027] While the foregoing description of the form of the apparatus constitutes a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is not meant to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined in the appended claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004138249-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The present invention relates to pyrrolo[2.1-a]dihydroisoquinolines which are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 10a and can be used for combating cancer.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"We claim:  \\n     \\n         1 .

Signal transduction via cAMP is associated with transcriptional events that can result in the inhibition of cellular proliferation (W. L. Lowe et al., Endocrinology 138, 2219 (1997); D.A. Albert, J. Clin. Invest. 95, 1490 (1995); M. I. Mednieks et al., FEBS Lett. 254, 83 (1989)). Indeed, elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration is growth inhibitory for several human tumor cell lines, including those derived from breast, lung and colorectal carcinomas (I. S. Fentimen et al., Mol. Biol. Med. 2, 81 (1984); P. Cassoni et al., Int. J. Cancer 72, 340 (1997); H. Shulamith et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 56, 1229 (1998); N. M. Hoosein et al., Regul. Peptides 24, 15 (1989)). In several human breast carcinoma cell lines, increased cAMP production through stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and/or reduction in cAMP catabolism through inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity has been shown to result in increased steady state levels of cAMP and growth inhibition (N. Veber et al., Eur. J. Cancer 30A, 1352 (1994); J. A. Fontana et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 78, 1107 (1987); T. A. Slotkin et al., Breast Cancer Res. and Treatment 60, 153 (2000)). In contrast to breast tumor cell lines, normal human mammary epithelial cells are stimulated to proliferate by elevation of intracellular cAMP (I. S. Fentimen et al., Mol. Biol. Med. 2, 81 (1984)). These observations suggest that elevation of intracellular cAMP may selectively inhibit breast tumor cell proliferation. Interestingly, it has been reported that neoplastic mammary tissues have higher levels of low-Km phosphodiesterase activity compared to normal breast tissue, suggesting that tumors may gain a growth or survival advantage by keeping intracellular cAMP levels in check (A. Larks Singer et al., Cancer Res. 36, 60 (1976)).  \\n       [0003] The ICAST (inhibitor of Cyclic AMP Signal Transduction) gene encodes a specific 3\\u2032,5\\u2032-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Compared to corresponding normal tissues, ICAST mRNA is overexpressed in breast carcinoma specimens, liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinomas. The ICAST cDNA was also recently cloned by other groups and named PDE 10a (K. Fujishige et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274, 18 438 (1999); S. H. Soderling et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 7071 (1999); K. Loughey et al., Gene 234, 109 (1999)). Published expression data for ICAST mRNA show a very limited distribution across adult human tissues, with highest levels observed in the testis, caudate nucleus and putamen (K. Fujishige et al., 1999). Increased expression of ICAST mRNA in human tumor specimens indicates that ICAST may play an important role in tumor cell growth and/or survival under conditions of elevated cAMP generation. Selective inhibition of ICAST activity in tumor cells should lead to increased cAMP concentrations and growth inhibition. The expression profile of ICAST and the published reports indicating that breast, lung and colon carcinomas are particularly sensitive to elevation of intracellular cAMP indicate that ICAST may play critical roles specifically in those tumor types. In addition to elevation of cAMP, inhibition of ICAST activity should also decrease the intracellular concentration of 5-AMP, which could limit purine pools and DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing tumor cells.  \\n       [0004] Certain pyrrolo[2.1-a]isoquinoline derivatives are known from the literature as, for example, hypotensive agents or psychotropic agents (e.g. GB-A 1,153,670; U.S. Pat.

As outlined above, the inhibition of PDE 10a is a promising approach for the treatment of cancer. The biological tests described below show that the compounds according to the invention exhibit a pronounced anti-proliferation activity against tumor cells; they are therefore useful for the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, our investigations showed that they are also useful for treatment of conditions of pain and/or for the lowering of the temperature of the body in fever conditions.  \\n       [0165] The compounds according to the invention can be used as active ingredients for the production of medicaments against carcinomatous disorders.

Preferably, the compounds according to the invention are used in an amount such that their concentration is approximately 0.5 to approximately 90% by weight, based on the ready-to-use formulations, the concentration being dependent, inter alia, on the indication of the medicament.  \\n       [0166] The formulations can be produced, for example, by extending the active compounds with solvents and/or excipients having the above properties, where, if appropriate, additionally emulsifiers or dispersants and, in the case of water as the solvent, an organic solvent can additionally be added.  \\n       [0167] Administration can be carried out in a customary manner, preferably orally, transdermally or parenterally, for example perlingually, buccally, intravenously, nasally, rectally or inhalationally.  \\n       [0168] For human use, in the case of oral administration, it is recommended to administer doses of from 0.001 to 50 mg/kg, preferably from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg.

Thus, in some cases it may be sufficient to manage with less than the above mentioned minimum amount, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, it may be recommended to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.  \\n       [0170] The compounds according to the invention are also suitable for use in veterinary medicine. For use in veterinary medicine, the compounds or their non-toxic salts can be administered in a suitable formulation in accordance with general veterinary practice.

Cells were plated at a density of 3000 cells per well in 100 \\u03bcL growth medium in a 96 well culture dish. 24 hours after plating, LDH activity was determined using the Cytotox 96 Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Kit (Promega, Madison, Wis., U.S.A.) to yield T 0h  LDH values. Briefly, cells were lysed with the addition of 200 \\u03bcL of Lysis Buffer (included in the Promega Kit) and lysates were further diluted 1:50 in Lysis Buffer. 50 \\u03bcL of diluted cell lysate were transferred to a fresh 96 well culture plate. The assay was initiated with the addition of 50 \\u03bcL of substrate per well. Color development was allowed to proceed for 10-15 minutes. The assay was terminated with the addition of 50 \\u03bcL of Stop Solution (included in Promega kit). Optical densities were determined spectrophotometrically at 490 nm in a 96 well plate reader (SpectraMax 250, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., U.S.A.).  \\n       [0184] Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stocks.

Test compounds were serially diluted in growth medium containing 0.4% DMSO to maintain constant DMSO concentrations for all wells. 50 \\u03bcL of fresh growth medium and 50 \\u03bcL of diluted test compound were added to each culture well to give a final volume of 200 \\u03bcL. The cells with and without individual test compounds were incubated for 72 hours at which time LDH activity was measured to yield T 72h  values.

Xenograft experiments are conducted using eight-to-ten week-old female athymic mice with an average body mass of 20-25 g. Approximately 5\\u00d710 6  cells in a total volume of 0.2 mL PBS were injected subcutaneously in the flank region. Thereafter the mice were randomized and divided into several groups that reflect different dosages or schedules, respectively (n=10 mice/group). The test compounds were administered starting at day 1 at different dosages (e.g. 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) and different schedules (e.g. Q1D\\u00d715, Q2D\\u00d77, Q3D\\u00d75). Test compounds were formulated for oral administration in a vehicle for oral administration composed of polyethylene glycol-400, \\u2122Cremophor, ethanol and 0.9% saline (40:5:5:50). Tumor measurements were performed twice per week. Tumor weights are calculated using the formula (a\\u00d7w 2 )/2.

JP41042778, Rodriguez ES2017138, Ab263897 and GB228829 all teach a mixture of cooked and uncooked flour to enhance the flavor of the flour. However, the problem with these resultant flours is that the precooked part tends to overcook and the raw part still needs 100% time to cook fully. While my fast cooking flour is 100% partly cooked. Thus it requires less time to make the end product from my fast cooking flour. Baker et al [U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,629] teaches a method for processing grain and legunie fully cooked powders and snacks. Bakers fully cooked flour will have no need to be cooked so it will have even more advantages of saving time and no pollution of the environment, over this applicant&#39;s application. However, Baker&#39;s flours purpose is limited. As it cannot be used in cooking flour containing products selected from the group consisting of breads, muffins, cakes, pizza, cookies, biscuits, brioches, tortillas, nans, and pancakes. As using the fully cooked Baker flour will result in overcooked bread etc. No prior art exists so far in relation to fast cooking flour.  \\n       BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION  \\n       [0005] The present invention relates to making available to the consumer fast cooking flours. I have discovered that any and all kind of flours available in the market can be partly precooked and made available to the consumer. Partly cooked flours have several advantages over what is available in the market today. Partly cooked flours save time, labor, fuel, money, materially enhance the quality of the environment, and enhance the flavor as well as prolong the life of the flour. Consider the following:  \\n       [0006] a) The grain for making the flour will be half-baked in large commercial facilities; thus the damage to the environment will be minimum, as the pollution will be controlled through efficient filters.  \\n       [0007] b) As the flour will already be half-cooked people will spend less time making bread and will have more time for their families.  \\n       [0008] c) Less work will mean less tiredness and more rest etc.  \\n       [0009] d) As bread tends to over cook on the outside and usually remains under cooked on the inside it will now be possible to cook the bread more evenly, enhancing the flavor of the bread. Same will happen with all other flour products.  \\n       [0010] e) As the half-baked flour will contain less moisture, it will be more seasoned than the raw flour and will last longer.  \\n       [0011] f) Commercial quantites of fast cooking flours can be made where fuel is cheap and available in large quantities.  \\n       [0012] g) Not just bread, but also everything that is made with conventional flour can be made with fast cooking flour and will have the same above advantages.  \\n       [0013] h) It has now been discovered that carmalization of bread causes cancer. Thus, fast cooking flours are more healthy. All other flours mentioned in the prior art cause carmalization.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n     [0014] The present invention relates to making available to the consumer fast cooking flours. The method of making the flour is to take the wheat grain or any other grain of which the flour is to be made and subject it to dry heat of 200 degrees F. for four hours in a closed vessel, the grain is then ground and the fast cooking flour is obtained. When the grain is subjected to a higher temperature, say b  300  l degrees F. the resultant grain when ground into flour is not of the same quality in flavor. However, the other benefits remain the same.  \\n     [0015] Fast cooking flours may also be produced by any one of the relevant processes described in previous U.S. patents. The material may also be made into fast cooking flour by partly cooking the desired cereal grain by using any suitable low moisture cooking method, including microwave and infrared energy.  \\n     [0016] Each and every flour that is available in the market today can be made into fast cooking flour before marketing. From single grain to multigrain, from the finely ground to the course, everything remains the same, except that it is partly cooked. Pastry flour, all-purpose flour, high gluten flour, whole wheat flour, bread flour, pancake flour, cassava flour, buckwheat flour, bran flour, soybean flour, barley flour, corn flour, oats flour, rye flour, rice flour, millet flour, etc. each and every kind of end product like cakes, pancakes, bread tortillas, chappaties, pizzas, nachos, nans, brioches, muffins, cookies, etc, can all be made with fast cooking flours.  \\n     [0017] French brioches were made with fast cooking flour. At a temperature of 370 degrees F. it took 17 minutes to bake. The same made with regular flour at the same temperature took 37 minutes to bake. Again corn biscuits were made with fast cooking corn flour. At a temperature of 375 degrees F. it took 12 minutes to bake. Corn biscuits made with conventional corn flour at the same temperature took 22 minutes to bake. Wheaten bread was made with fast cooking bread flour. At a temperature of 425 degrees F. it took 18 minutes to bake. With regular bread flour at the same temperature it took 35 minutes. In all three cases the flavor was much better. Also there was no carmalization of the outter shell when cooked with fast cooking flour in all three cases.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004166739-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"An electrical connector assembly includes a first connector with a dielectric housing mounting a plurality of terminals having pin portions.

In many electrical connectors, the terminals have male, or pin, portions for engaging the terminals of the complementary mating connector. For instance, the mating connector will have female or receptacle terminals for receiving the pin portions of the terminals of the first connector. Unfortunately, problems are encountered in bending or otherwise damaging the terminal pin portions. This problem is magnified with the ever-increasing miniaturization of electrical connectors, whereby such terminal pin portions are very small components of the connector assembly.  \\n       [0003] Efforts have been made to provide protection for the pin portions of terminals as described above. For instance, pin alignment, or stabilizing, plates have been used, with such plates having a plurality of holes for receiving the terminal pin portions to maintain the alignment and spacing of the pin portions and prevent bending thereof or other damage thereto. The alignment or stabilizing plates may be removed or remain in place before the connector is mated, or it has been known to provide an arrangement whereby the mating connector moves the plate from an outer protecting position, inwardly along the pin portions to an inner mating position. Unfortunately, once the plate has been moved inwardly, the pin portions no longer are protected should the connectors be unmated. This creates problems in electrical connector assemblies wherein the respective connectors are used in applications that require cyclical mating and unmating of the respective connectors.  \\n       [0004] The present invention is directed to solving these problems by providing a connector and a connector assembly utilizing a pin stabilizing plate that is movably disposed on one of the connectors of the connector assembly and which is moved back and forth between protecting and mating positions in response to mating and unmating of a pair of connectors.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0005] An object, therefore, of the invention is to provide an electrical connector assembly with a new and improved terminal pin stabilizing plate system.  \\n       [0006] In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, an electrical connector assembly includes a first electrical connector having a dielectric housing mounting a plurality of conductive terminals which have projecting, male pin portions. A stabilizing plate is provided that includes a plurality of apertures that receive the terminal pin portions. The stabilizing plate is movable from a protecting position generally at distal ends of the pin portions to a mating position spaced inwardly of the distal ends, in which the free ends of the terminal pin portions are exposed for mating with corresponding terminals of an opposing connector.  \\n       [0007] A second electrical connector is mateable with the first electrical connector and includes a mating portion for engaging the pin stabilizing plate and moving the plate rearwardly from its protecting position to its mating position in response to mating of the connectors. Complementary interengaging return means are provided between the second electrical connector and the pin stabilizing plate for moving the plate forwardly, back from its mating position to its protecting position in response to unmating of the connectors.  \\n       [0008] As disclosed herein, complementary interengaging stop means are provided between the first electrical connector and the pin stabilizing plate to prevent the plate from moving beyond its protecting position when the plate is moved back from its mating position to the protecting position. In the preferred embodiment, the stop means include abutting shoulders disposed on the first connector and on the pin stabilizing plate.  \\n       [0009] According to one principal aspect of the invention, the complementary interengaging return means may include a flexible latch arm disposed on one of either the second electrical connector or the pin stabilizing plate which is engageable with a latch boss disposed on one of the other of the second electrical connector or pin stabilizing plate. The flexible latch arm has a first angled surface for engaging and riding over the latch boss, whereby the latch arm will snap into locking engagement with the latch boss upon mating of the first and second connectors. The flexible latch arm further preferably has a second angled surface for engaging and riding over the latch boss upon unmating of the two connectors. A pair of the flexible latch arms are provided for engaging opposite sides of the latch boss, which latch boss is preferably diamond-shaped so as to define two pairs of angled surfaces that are engageable with the respective angled surfaces of the pair of flexible latch arms. Still further, in the preferred embodiment, two spaced-apart pairs of the flexible latch arms are provided on the second electrical connector, with a pair of spaced-apart bosses provided on the pin stabilizing plate.  \\n       [0010] According to another aspect of the invention, the connector housing of the first electrical connector includes an elongated guide wall located amidst the pin portions of the terminals and projecting in the same direction as the pin portions. The pin stabilizing plate includes an elongated opening embracing the elongated guide wall for guiding the plate in its movement between the protecting and mating positions.  \\n       [0011] Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0012] In the course of the following detailed description, reference will be frequently made to the accompanying drawings in which:  \\n     [0013]FIG. 1 is a perspective view looking at a first or header connector with the pin stabilizing plate in its protecting position;  \\n     [0014]FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the header connector of FIG. 1 taken at a different angle and with the pin stabilizing plate in its mating position;  \\n     [0015]FIG. 3 is an enlarged perspective view of the center of the pin stabilizing plate;  \\n     [0016]FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a second or mating connector which is mateable with the header connector of FIGS. 1 and 2; and,  \\n     [0017]FIG. 5 is an enlarged perspective view of a center portion of the mating connector showing one of the pairs of flexible latch arms which engage the pin stabilizing plate of the header connector. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  \\n     [0018] Referring to the drawings in greater detail, and first to FIGS. 1 and 2, the invention is embodied in an electrical connector assembly which includes a first or header connector, generally designated  10 , which is mateable with a second, or mating connector, generally designated  12  in FIG. 5 and described hereinafter. The header connector  10  includes a housing  14  formed from a dielectric material, to which is mounted a plurality of conductive terminals, generally designated  16  (FIG. 2). The housing is preferably unitarily molded of plastic material and has a shroud  18  which encircles and defines a mating area of the connector  10 , and which projects forwardly in a mating direction. The conductive terminals  16  include male pin portions  16   a  that project from the housing  14  and are arranged within the shroud  18  as seen in FIG. 2. The terminals  16  have tail portions  16   b  which may project from the bottom of the housing  14  as illustrated, or which may extend from a rear face of the connector housing  14 .  \\n     [0019] It should be understood that the invention is applicable for use in a wide variety of electrical connectors other than connectors  10  and  12  of the connector assembly shown in the drawings. Many configurations of electrical connectors have projecting terminal pins or pin portions which require protection and with which the unique pin stabilizing plate concepts of the invention are applicable.  \\n     [0020] With that understanding, the housing  14  of the header connector  10  includes a pair of mounting posts  20  or the like (FIG. 2) which assist in mounting the connector  10  onto a printed circuit board (not shown). Tail portions  16   b  of the terminals  16  are inserted into through holes in the printed circuit board for electrical connection to appropriate circuit traces on the board and/or in the through holes. A pair of polarizing ribs  22  may be disposed on th exterior of the connector  10  and are shown as projecting outwardly from one edge of the shroud  18  and they extend in the mating direction of the connector  10 , for purposes described hereinafter. A latch structure  24  may projects along the opposite edge of the shroud  18 . A plurality of probes  26  extend forwardly in the same direction as pin portions  16   c , for purposes to be described in greater detail hereinafter.  \\n     [0021] The invention herein is embodied in a unique pin stabilizing system which includes a pin stabilizing plate  28  that is located within the shroud  18  of the housing  14  and which is moveable along the male pin portions  16   a  of the terminals  16 . The pin stabilizing plate  28  includes a plurality of apertures  30  disposed therein for receiving the terminal pin portions  16   a . The pin stabilizing plate  28  also preferably includes a plurality of holes  31  through which the probes  26  freely extend. Basically, the pin stabilizing plate  28  is movable between two operative positions, one being an outer protecting position shown in FIG. 1 and the other position being an inner mating position shown in FIG. 2. In the outer protecting position of FIG. 1, the pin stabilizing plate  28  is located generally at the distal ends  16   c  of the terminal pin portions  16   a . The pin stabilizing plate  28  is preferably molded, or otherwise formed from an electrically insulative material, such as a plastic.  \\n     [0022] As seen best in FIGS. 1 and 2, an elongated planar guide wall  32  may be molded integrally with the housing  14  (or otherwise formed therewith) generally centrally amidst the terminal pin portions  16   a . A pair of integral guide ribs  32   a  project outwardly from opposite sides of elongated guide wall  32  and extend in the direction of movement of the pin stabilizing plate. An elongated stop flange  32   b  (FIG. 2) projects outwardly the perimeter of the elongated guide wall  32 .  \\n     [0023] Referring to FIG. 3 in conjunction with FIGS. 1 and 2, a generally rectangular, elongated guide wall  34  is formed as part of, and preferably molded integrally with the pin stabilizing plate  28  and projects at least partially outwardly therefrom. The rectangular guide wall defines an elongated opening  35  that extends vertically as shown in the drawings and which embraces the elongated planar guide wall  32  as seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, so that the pin stabilizing plate  28  can ride along the planar guide wall  34  between its protecting position (FIG. 1) and its mating position (FIG. 2). Of course, the planar guide wall  32  could be on the pin stabilizer plate and the rectangular guide wall  34  could be on the housing.  \\n     [0024] The rectangular guide wall  34  has a pair of slots  34   a  formed therein that receive the ribs  32   a  of the planar guide wall  32 . An elongated stop flange  34   b  (FIG. 3) is disposed at each opposite side of opening  35  within the rectangular guide wall  34  for engaging stop flanges  32   b  (FIG. 2) of the planar guide wall  32  for purposes described hereinafter. Finally, an angularly configured and preferably diamond-shaped latch boss  36  is disposed at opposite ends of the elongated rectangular guide wall  34  and these bosses  36  project outwardly. Each latch boss preferably includes a pair of outwardly facing surfaces  36   a  and a pair of inwardly facing angled surfaces  36   b  defined thereon, again for purposes described hereinafter.  \\n     [0025] In assembly of the header connector  10 , the pin stabilizing plate  28  first is assembled within the shroud  18  of the housing  14  before the conductive terminals  16  are mounted in the housing  14 . The pin stabilizing plate  28  is then inserted into the shroud  18  by positioning the rectangular guide wall  34  of the stabilizing plate  28  over the planar guide wall  32  of the housing  14 . The stabilizing plate  28  is pushed inwardly until stop flanges  34   b  (FIG. 3) on the inside of rectangular guide wall  34  ride over and \\u201csnap\\u201d behind stop flanges  32   b  (FIG. 2) on opposite sides of planar guide wall  32 . The inner position of the pin stabilizing plate  28  corresponds to the mating position shown in FIG. 2 and is defined by the pin stabilizing plate  28  bottoming out against a bottom wall of the housing  14  within shroud  18 . The bottom wall of the housing is not visible in the drawings because it is hidden behind the pin stabilizing plate as shown.  \\n     [0026] After the pin stabilizing plate is assembled as described above, the terminals  16  are appropriately mounted within the housing  14 , and the terminal pin portions  16   a  are inserted through corresponding apertures  30  formed in the pin stabilizing plate  28 . The stabilizing plate  28  then is pulled outwardly either manually or robotically to its protecting position shown in FIG. 1. This position is defined by the stop flanges  34   b  inside the rectangular guide wall  34  abutting against the stop flanges  32   b  on opposite sides of planar guide wall  32 . The connector  10  now is ready for use and for mating with a complementary mating connector, such as mating connector  12  shown in FIG. 4.  \\n     [0027] Referring now to FIG. 4, the mating connector  12  is shown to include an outer housing  40  having an inner plug portion  42 . During mating of the two connectors  10  &amp;  12 , the shroud  18  of the header connector  10  moves into a groove  44  disposed between the outer housing  40  and the inner plug portion  42  of the mating connector  12 , while the inner plug portion  42  is inserted into the shroud  18 . Outer housing  40  of the mating connector  12  has a pair of polarizing channels  46  disposed on one side thereof for receiving the corresponding polarizing ribs  22  of the header connector  10 . The opposite side of the outer housing  40  includes a cutout  48  for receiving the latch structure  24  of header connector  10 . The latch structure  24  is engageable with a latch structure on the mating connector  12 , but which is not visible in FIG. 4.  \\n     [0028] At this point, it should be explained that the inner plug portion  42  of the mating connector  12  includes a plurality of terminal-receiving passages  50  which receive a plurality of female or receptacle terminals that receive the terminal pin portions  16   a  of the header connector  10 . In addition, the plug portion  42  includes a plurality of passages  52  formed therein which may support a plurality of shorting bars for engagement by probes  26  of the mating connector  10 . The shorting bars and the female terminals are not shown in FIG. 4 because their presence would significantly clutter the depiction in FIG. 4, keeping in mind the above statements that the invention is applicable for use with a wide variety of different connector configurations.  \\n     [0029] With that understanding, referring to FIG. 5 in connection with FIG. 4, the plug portion  42  of the mating connector  12  includes a large central opening  54  which receives the planar guide wall  32  surrounded by rectangular guide wall  34  of the pin stabilizing plate  28  of the header connector  10 . A pair of flexible latch arms  56  are molded integrally with the plug portion  42  at each opposite end of opening  54  for operative association with the latch bosses  36  at opposite ends of the rectangular guide wall  34  of the pin stabilizing plate  28 .  \\n     [0030] Referring to FIG. 5 in conjunction with FIG. 3, the flexible latch arms  56  of each pair thereof define a pair of outwardly facing angled surfaces  56   a  for engaging angled surfaces  36   a  of one of the latch bosses  36 . The pair of latch arms  56  have a pair of inwardly facing angled surfaces  56   b  for engaging the inwardly facing angled surfaces  36   b  of an opposing one of the latch bosses  36 . Angled surfaces  56   a  and  56   b  of the flexible latch arms  56  are defined by opposite sides of opposing hook portions  58  of the latch arms  56 .  \\n     [0031] The mating and unmating of connectors  10  and  12 , along with the movement of pin stabilizing plate  28  in conjunction with the interengagement of the flexible latch arms  56  on the mating connector and latch bosses  36  on the pin stabilizing plate, now will be described. Mating connector  12  is mated with the header connector  10  by inserting the inner plug portion  42  of the mating connector into the shroud  18  of the header connector  10 , with the pin stabilizing plate  28  in its protecting position as shown in FIG. 1 as described above. The angled surfaces  56   a  of the flexible latch arms  56  will engage the opposing angled surfaces  36   a  of latch bosses  36 , moving the pin stabilizing plate  28  inwardly toward its mating position of FIG. 2. As the pin stabilizing plate  28  reaches its innermost mating position, the engagement of the angled surfaces  56   a  on the flexible latch arms  56  and the angled surfaces  36   a  on the latch bosses  36 , will cause the flexible latch arms  56  to spread outwardly away from each other until the latch arms  56  pass the latch bosses  36 , whereupon the latch arms  56  will resiliently \\u201csnap\\u201d back inwardly in place behind the latch bosses  36 . The connectors  10 ,  12  now are fully mated, with the pin stabilizing plate  28  in its mated position shown in FIG. 2, and with pin portions  16  of terminal pins  16  inserted into the female terminals of mating connector  12 .  \\n     [0032] During unmating, the angled surfaces  56   b  of the flexible latch arms  56  will engage the angled surfaces  36   b  of the latch arms  36  and pull the pin stabilizing plate  28  outwardly with the mating connector. In essence, those angled surfaces of the flexible latch arms  56  form complementary interengaging return means between the mating connector and the pin stabilizing plate for moving the pin stabilizing plate  28  back from its mating position to its protecting position automatically in response to unmating of the connectors.  \\n     [0033] Once the pin stabilizing plate  28  reaches its projecting position of FIG. 1, the stop flanges  34   b  (FIG. 3) on opposite sides of rectangular guide wall  34  of the pin stabilizing plate  28  engage the stop flanges  32   b  on opposite sides of the planar guide wall  32  of the header connector housing  14 . These stop flanges  32   b  are effective to prevent any further outwardly movement of the pin stabilizing plate  28  beyond its protecting position of FIG. 1. Flexible latch arms  56  then will be forced outwardly by the engagement of angled surfaces  56   b  thereof with the angled surfaces  36   b  of the latch bosses  36 , whereby the flexible latch arms  56  thereupon ride over the latch bosses  36  and the mating connector  12  can be unmated from its engagement with the header connector  10 . In other words, the abutting resistive forces between stop flanges  32   b  and  34   b  are greater than the resistive forces between the flexible latch arms  56  and latch bosses  36 . This can be easily determined by making the angle of angled surfaces  56   b  and  36   b  such that they are overcome by the resistive engagement forces between stop flanges  32   b  and  34   b.    \\n     [0034] During movement of the pin stabilizing plate  28  between its protecting and mating positions, elongated planar guide wall  32  and elongated rectangular guide wall  34  are very effective to provide for smooth guiding movement of the pin stabilizing plate  28  without any binding thereof.  \\n     [0035] While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, although the pin stabilizing plate  28  is shown in the preferred embodiments as having a center slot  35  that receives an rides upon the center guide wall  32 , the connector housing  14  could be formed with the slot and the pin stabilizing plate could be formed with a guide wall that extends into the slot when the two connectors are fully mated. Additionally, one could utilize detents, bumps or other projections formed on the opposing (second) connector that would deflect over the angled surfaces of the latch bosses. Similarly, the pin stabilizing plate  28  may be held in its protecting position by a series of bumps.

Field of the Invention  \\n       [0003] The present invention relates to a power supply system, and more particularly to a power supply including a self-excited flyback converter.  \\n       [0004] 2. Description of the Related Art  \\n       [0005] (Basic Operation of Switching Power Supply Unit)  \\n       [0006] A power supply system using a commercial power supply usually includes an AC/DC converter for obtaining a DC output. As such an AC/DC converter, a self-excited flyback converter (or called a ringing choke converter (RCC)) has been widely used conventionally.  \\n       [0007]FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of a conventional self-excited flyback converter. An isolating transformer  1  has a primary winding Np at the input side, a secondary winding Ns at the output side, and an auxiliary winding Nb at the primary side. The auxiliary winding Nb is a drive winding of a transistor  3  for controlling the gate voltage of a MOS-FET  2 , a switching device. The input voltage E is a DC voltage obtained by rectifying an AC input voltage by a set of bridge diodes and by smoothing through an aluminum electrolytic capacitor. The input voltage E appears across the aluminum electrolytic capacitor. The bridge diodes and the aluminum electrolytic capacitor are not shown.  \\n       [0008] The input voltage E is applied across a terminal of the winding Np connected to the drain terminal of the MOS-FET  2  via a terminal of the primary winding Np, having its (+) side connected to the start of the winding Np and its (\\u2212) side connected to the source terminal of the MOS-FET  2 . The auxiliary winding Nb is placed in the same polarity with the primary winding Np, and the secondary winding Ns is placed in the opposite polarity. The MOS-FET  2  has its gate terminal connected to starting resistors  4  and  5 . In addition, a capacitor  6  and gate resistors  7  and  8  are connected across the gate terminal of the MOS-FET  2  and the start of the auxiliary winding Nb. A diode  9  is connected in parallel with the gate resistor  8  with its cathode facing to the auxiliary winding Nb side to control the turn-on and turn-off speed of the MOS-FET  2 .  \\n       [0009] A capacitor  10  is connected across the base of the transistor  3  and the (\\u2212) side of the input voltage. A resistor  11  is connected across the auxiliary winding Nb and the base of the transistor  3 , and constitutes a time constant circuit with the capacitor  10 .  \\n       [0010] A photocoupler  12  has its collector connected to the gate of the MOS-FET  2  via a resistor  13  for limiting the current flowing through the photocoupler  12 , and has its emitter connected to the base of the transistor  3 . The isolating transformer  1  has the end of the secondary winding Ns connected to the anode of a rectifying diode  14 . An electrolytic capacitor  15  is connected across the cathode of the diode  14  and the start of the secondary winding Ns.  \\n       [0011] The output voltage Vo is divided by resistors  16  and  17 , and the divided voltage is applied to the inverting input terminal of an operational amplifier  18 . A reference voltage generated by a Zener diode  19  and a resistor  20  is supplied to the non-inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier  18 . Thus, the operational amplifier  18  compares the voltage applied to the inverting input terminal with the input reference voltage, and adjusts its output voltage, thereby controlling the current flowing through the diode in the photocoupler  12  via a resistor  21 . A resistor  22  and a capacitor  23  connected across the inverting input terminal and output terminal of the operational amplifier  18  are provided for adjusting the gain and phase of the closed loop.  \\n       [0012] First, the input voltage E brings the MOS-FET  2  into conduction because the starting resistors  4  and  5  apply a bias to its gate terminal. Thus, the input voltage E is applied to the primary winding Np, and induces a voltage across the auxiliary winding Nb with the (+) of the voltage being at the start side of the winding. Although a voltage is induced across the secondary winding Ns, the voltage is not transferred to the secondary side because the voltage has its (\\u2212) at the anode side of the rectifier diode  14 . Accordingly, the current flowing through the primary winding Np is only the exciting current of the isolating transformer  1 , and the isolating transformer  1  stores the energy proportional to the square of the exciting current which increases in proportion to time. The voltage induced across the auxiliary winding Nb charges the gate of the MOS-FET  2  via the capacitor  6  and resistors  7  and  8 , thereby continuing the conduction state of the MOS-FET  2 .  \\n       [0013] The capacitor  10 , which constitutes the time constant circuit with the resistor  11 , is charged by the current from the auxiliary winding Nb. When the voltage across the capacitor  10  exceeds Vbe of the transistor  3 , the transistor  3  conducts, which reduces the gate voltage of the MOS-FET  2  and brings the MOS-FET  2  out of conduction. Thus, voltages opposing to the voltages at the start are induced across the individual windings of the isolating transformer so that the secondary winding generates the voltage having its (+) at the anode side of the rectifier diode  14 . As a result, the energy stored in the isolating transformer  1  is rectified and smoothed, and transferred to the secondary side. When the energy stored in the isolating transformer  1  is completely transferred to the secondary side, the MOS-FET  2  conducts again.  \\n       [0014] The reason for this is as follows. The voltage proportional to the drain-source voltage of the MOS-FET  2  is induced across the auxiliary winding Nb. On the other hand, immediately after the MOS-FET  2  is brought out of conduction, the gate terminal is biased at (\\u2212), and the (\\u2212) bias gradually reduces when the transfer of the energy to the secondary side is completed. Thus, the gate terminal of the MOS-FET  2  is biased toward the (+) direction again through the coupling capacitor  6 .  \\n       [0015] The photocoupler  12  increases its current with an increase of the output voltage Vo, and supplies an increasing current to the capacitor  10 , thereby reducing the charge time. This reduces the conduction duration of the MOS-FET  2  and the energy stored in the isolating transformer  1 , thereby carrying out the constant voltage operation by decreasing the output voltage Vo. When the output voltage is low, the operation is carried out in the opposite direction.  \\n       [0016]FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating current or voltage waveforms at various portions of the self-excited flyback converter. In FIG. 6, V G  designates the gate voltage of the MOS-FET  2 , V DS  designates the drain-source voltage of the MOS-FET  2 , I D  designates the drain current, V Ns  designates the voltage induced across the secondary winding Ns, I S  designates the current flowing through the rectifier diode  14  at the secondary side, and V Nb  designates the voltage induced across the auxiliary winding N b .  \\n       [0017] First, the ON period of the MOS-FET  2  will be described. When the gate bias is applied via the starting resistors  4  and  5 , it increases the potential of V G , and brings the MOS-FET  2  into conduction. Accordingly, the current ID increases linearly with time, and stores energy in the isolating transformer  1 . In this case, since the MOS-FET  2  is in the conduction state, V DS  maintains its potential at nearly zero. On the other hand, although the rectifier diode  14  at the secondary side is supplied with V Ns , since it provides the reverse bias, I S  is kept zero. The auxiliary winding Nb has the voltage indicated by V Nb  in this case.  \\n       [0018] When the capacitor  10  is charged, the transistor  3  conducts and the gate voltage V G  of the MOS-FET  2  becomes zero, thereby bringing the MOS-FET  2  out of conduction. Accordingly, ID becomes zero, and V DS  equals the sum of the output voltage of the secondary side multiplied by the turn ratio for the input voltage E plus the surge voltage. In this case, the rectifier diode  14  at the secondary side conducts, and the energy stored in the isolating transformer  1  is transferred to the secondary side. The current I S  linearly reduces with the negative slope, so that the auxiliary winding generates a negative voltage.  \\n       [0019] (Operation of DC/DC Converter)  \\n       [0020] A DC-DC converter is usually used in the power supply system to convert the output voltage from the switching power supply to a desired voltage level. In the conventional power supply system, a step-down DC-DC converter has been widely used as such a DC-DC converter.  \\n       [0021]FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of the step-down DC-DC converter. The step-down DC-DC converter is placed in the post-stage of the switching power supply unit to generate any specified DC output voltage (V1) from the DC output voltage (Vo) of the switching power supply unit. The step-down DC-DC converter mainly comprises an input capacitor  28 , a p-channel MOS-FET  29 , an inductor  30 , a diode  31 , and a rectifier capacitor  32 . The p-channel MOS-FET  29  has its source connected to the Vo side, and the drain connected to a first terminal of the inductor  30 . The rectifier capacitor  32  is connected across the second terminal of the inductor  30  and the ground GND. On the MOS-FET  29  side of the inductor  30  is connected the cathode of the diode  31  whose anode is connected to GND. A comparator  33  has its output terminal connected to the gate of the MOS-FET  29  via a resistor  34 . The non-inverting input terminal of the comparator  33  is supplied with the output voltage (V1) via a resistor  35  as a detection voltage, and the inverting input terminal is supplied with a voltage obtained by dividing the input voltage (Vo) by resistors  36  and  37 . When the output voltage supplied to the non-inverting input terminal is lower than the reference voltage supplied to the inverting input terminal, the output of the comparator  33  becomes Low level. Thus, the p-channel MOS-FET  29  conducts, and the capacitor  32  is charged through the inductor  30 . When the non-inverting input terminal voltage exceeds the inverting input terminal voltage because of the charge of the capacitor  32 , the output of the comparator  33  becomes High level. Thus, the p-channel MOS-FET  29  is brought out of conduction, and the diode  31  conducts, thereby terminating the regenerative cycle of the inductor  30 . Repeating the foregoing operation, the DC/DC converter supplies the specified DC output voltage to an apparatus such as a micro-controller.  \\n       [0022] (Operation of Overvoltage Protection Circuit)  \\n       [0023] Next, the operation of an overvoltage protection circuit for preventing the overvoltage at the time of an open loop, device destruction or the like in the conventional switching power supply unit will be described with reference to FIG. 5. The Zener diode  25  has its cathode connected to the output side terminal via the resistor  24 , and its anode terminal connected to the anode terminal of the phototransmitter side of the photocoupler  26  for transferring a signal. The cathode terminal of the phototransmitter side is connected to the GND terminal.  \\n       [0024] The MOS-FET  2  has its gate terminal connected to the anode terminal of a thyristor  27  for the latch operation, and its source terminal connected to the cathode terminal of the thyristor  27 . The photoreceptor side transistor of the photocoupler  26  has its collector connected to the gate terminal of the MOS-FET  2 , and its emitter connected to the gate terminal of the thyristor  27 .  \\n       [0025] If the feedback signal is lost because of the short-circuit between the input terminals of the operational amplifier  18  or because of the device open of the photocoupler  12 , for example, the normal closed-loop control becomes impossible, thereby increasing the output voltage. This will bring about a failure in the output side circuit, or action of the explosion-proof valve of the aluminum electrolytic capacitor.  \\n       [0026] To curb the abnormal increase in the output voltage, the conventional apparatus carries out the protective operation with the circuit including the Zener diode  25 , photocoupler  26 , thyristor  27  and the like. The operation will now be described.  \\n       [0027] If the output voltage exceeds the operation voltage of the Zener diode  25  because of an abnormal operation of the closed-loop control, a current flows through the phototransmitter side of the photocoupler  26  via the resistor  24 . The current is transmitted to the photoreceptor side of the photocoupler  25 , and supplies the gate terminal of the thyristor  27  with a trigger current. Thus, a current flows through the thyristor  27  from its anode to cathode, thereby reducing the gate voltage of the MOS-FET  2 . The reduction in the gate voltage halts the oscillation of the MOS-FET  2 , thereby reducing the output voltage.  \\n       [0028] Since the thyristor  27  is supplied with the hold current from the starting resistor  4  side, the MOS-FET  2  continues to halt the oscillation until the AC input is turned off and the hold current is removed. As a result, the output voltage (Vo) is reduced, and the post-stage DC-DC converter stops its operation, reducing the DC output voltage (V1) of the DC-DC converter.  \\n       [0029] The conventional circuit configuration, however, has a problem of increasing the cost of the components because of the expensive thyristor used for preventing the overvoltage.  \\n       [0030] In addition, it has a problem of requiring an additional filter circuit to prevent the misoperation of the thyristor due to injection noise.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0031] The present invention is implemented to solve the foregoing problem. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a low-cost power supply system and to circumvent the additional filter circuit by constructing the overvoltage protection circuit without using the thyristor.  \\n       [0032] To accomplish the objects, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an AC/DC converter comprising: a switching device for switching supply of a DC voltage to a primary side of a transformer, the DC voltage being obtained by rectifying and smoothing an AC voltage fed from a commercial power supply; a rectifier circuit for rectifying a secondary side output of the transformer; a first control circuit for controlling the switching device such that a constant output voltage is produced from an output terminal; and a second control circuit for controlling the switching device such that the voltage of the output terminal becomes a predetermined voltage higher than the constant output voltage.  \\n       [0033] According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a power supply system comprising: an AC/DC converter controlled such that a constant output voltage is produced from an output terminal, and that when the constant output voltage cannot be output from the output terminal, a predetermined voltage higher than the constant output voltage is output; and a DC-DC converter including a converter for converting the predetermined voltage output from the AC/DC converter, and a protective circuit for halting the converting operation if the AC/DC converter produces the predetermined voltage.  \\n       [0034] The power supply system may further comprise a reset circuit for supervising the output of the DC-DC converter voltage, and for outputting a reset signal when the DC-DC converter halts the converting operation.  \\n       [0035] The above and other objects, effects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of embodiments thereof taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0036]FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of an AC/DC converter of an embodiment in accordance with the present invention;  \\n     [0037]FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of a DC/DC converter of the embodiment in accordance with the present invention;  \\n     [0038]FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a micro-controller and reset IC operated by the DC output voltage of the DC-DC converter;  \\n     [0039]FIG. 4 is a waveform diagram illustrating the operation from an increase in the output voltage because of an abnormal condition of the AC/DC converter to the reset of the micro-controller;  \\n     [0040]FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of a conventional self-excited flyback converter;  \\n     [0041]FIG. 6 is a waveform diagram illustrating the currents or voltages in various portions of the RCC circuit; and  \\n     [0042]FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of a DC-DC converter. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0043] The embodiments in accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.  \\n     [0044]FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of an AC/DC converter of an embodiment in accordance with the present invention; and FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram showing a basic configuration of a DC/DC converter of the embodiment in accordance with the present invention. In these figures, the components having the same functions as those of the conventional technique as shown in FIGS. 5 and 7 are designated by the same reference numerals, and the description of their operation is omitted here.  \\n     [0045] The apparatus of FIG. 1 differs from the conventional technique in that it includes, instead of the thyristor  27 , a sub-loop control circuit for controlling the switching device such that the voltage at the output terminal becomes a predetermined voltage when it exceeds a constant voltage. The sub-loop control circuit is configured such that the photoreceptor side transistor of the photocoupler  26  has its collector terminal connected to the gate terminal of the MOS-FET  2  via a resistor  38 , and its emitter terminal connected to the base terminal of the transistor  3 , and that the phototransmitter side of the photocoupler  26  is connected to an operational amplifier  39 , resistors  40 - 43 , and a Zener diode  44 . Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 2, the DC-DC converter in accordance with the present invention includes, in addition to the components of the conventional DC-DC converter, the overvoltage protective function, and a Zener diode  45  connected across the input of the converter and the non-inverting input terminal of the comparator  33  having its anode connected to the non-inverting input terminal in order to increase the durability to the overvoltage. The operation of the present embodiment will be described below.  \\n     [0046] (Sub-Loop Control)  \\n     [0047] In the sub-loop control circuit of the switching power supply as shown in FIG. 1, the operational amplifier  39  has its inverting input terminal connected to the detection voltage divided by the resistors  41  and  42 , and its non-inverting input terminal supplied with the reference voltage generated by the Zener diode  44  and the resistor  43 . Here, assume that the voltage value of the output voltage Vo is Vacdc1 which is output from the output terminal during the main-loop control for converting the input DC voltage to the constant output voltage by controlling the switching device, and that the voltage value of the output voltage Vo during the sub-loop control is Vacdc2. In this case, the inequality Vacdc2&gt;Vacdc1 holds, which means that when the DC output voltage Vo exceeds the Vacdc1, the sub-loop control circuit begins to control the AC/DC converter.  \\n     [0048] When the sub-loop control circuit takes over the control, the operational amplifier  39  compares the input voltage to the inverting input terminal with the reference voltage, and controls the current flowing through the diode of photocoupler  26  via the resistor  40  by adjusting the voltage of the output terminal. The method of carrying out the constant voltage control by varying the current flowing through the photoreceptor of the photocoupler  26  is the same as that of the photocoupler  12  described in the conventional technique. Thus, the AC/DC converter maintains its operation by the sub-loop control until the DC output voltage exceeds Vacdc1 and reaches Vacdc2.  \\n     [0049] (Overvoltage Protective Function)  \\n     [0050] Next, the operation of the DC-DC converter as shown in FIG. 2 at an increase in the input voltage will be described. The Zener diode  45  is connected across the source terminal of the MOS-FET  29  and the non-inverting input terminal of the comparator  33 . Thus, if the input voltage to the DC-DC converter increases and exceeds the voltage equal to the non-inverting input terminal voltage plus the operation voltage (Vz) of the Zener diode  45 , that is, the protective voltage of the DC-DC converter, the Zener diode  45  conducts, and the non-inverting input terminal voltage of the comparator  33  becomes higher than the inverting input terminal voltage. As a result, the oscillation of the MOS-FET  29  stops and the DC output voltage is reduced. The reduction in the output continues as long as the Zener diode  45  keeps the conduction state.  \\n     [0051] To reduce the output by the foregoing operation, it is necessary for the sum voltage (Vz+V1) of the Zener voltage (Vz) across the Zener diode  45  and the output voltage (V1) of the DC-DC converter to be lower than the output voltage (Vacdc2) during the sub-loop control. In addition, to prevent the reduction in the output of the DC-DC converter during the main-loop control, the following relationship is required.  \\n       Vacdc 1 &lt;Vz+V 1 &lt;Vacdc 2  \\n     [0052] Therefore the combination of the foregoing sub-loop control and the overvoltage protective function can reduce the output of the DC-DC converter positively, and secure the function of the switching power supply as the conventional one without using the thyristor.  \\n     [0053]FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a micro-controller  54  as an apparatus operating at the DC output voltage of the DC-DC converter of FIG. 2, and a reset IC  53  incorporating a reset circuit for supervising the DC output voltage. The reset IC  53  comprises an operational amplifier  46 , a MOS-FET  47 , a reference voltage generating circuit  48 , and a delay circuit  49 . The operational amplifier  46  has its inverting input terminal connected to the voltage obtained by dividing the detection voltage by the resistors  50  and  51 , and compares it with the reference voltage at the non-inverting input terminal supplied from the reference voltage generating circuit  48 . Thus, the operational amplifier  46  varies its output.  \\n     [0054] The operational amplifier  46  has its output connected to the delay circuit  49  to prevent the MOS-FET  47  from varying its output immediately in response to the detection voltage. The reset IC  53  has the open drain output employing the drain of the MOS-FET  47  as the output terminal. A pull-up resistor  52  is connected across the output of the reset IC  53  and the /Reset input of the micro-controller  54 . For example, since the inverting input terminal voltage is lower than the non-inverting input terminal voltage at turn-on, the output of the operational amplifier  46  is place at the High level. Accordingly, the MOS-FET  47  is brought into conduction, and the output of the reset IC becomes Low, thereby holding the reset state of the micro-controller  54 .  \\n     [0055] When the inverting input terminal voltage exceeds the non-inverting input terminal voltage because of an increase in the power supply voltage, the output of the operational amplifier  46  becomes Low. Thus, the MOS-FET  47  is brought out of conduction, the output of the reset IC  53  is placed at the High level, and the reset state of the micro-controller  54  is released. The operation of the reset IC  53  enables the hold and release of the reset state of the micro-controller  54  independently of the rising characteristics of the power supply voltage.  \\n     [0056]FIG. 4 is a waveform diagram illustrating the operation from an increase in the output voltage due to the abnormal condition (such as an open-loop operation) of the AC/DC converter to the reset of the micro-controller  54 .  \\n     [0057] First, when the main-loop control by the first control circuit is halted because of the open loop, the sub-loop control is activated so that the output voltage (Vo) of the switching power supply starts to increase from Vacdc1. When the output voltage (Vo) of the switching power supply reaches Vz+V1, the DC-DC converter halts its operation, and the output voltage (V1) starts to decrease. When the output (V1) reduces to the reset voltage, the reset IC  53  operates and places the /Reset signal of the micro-controller  54  at Low.

The present inventors found through their study that when the aqueous layer is used again after pH adjustment with an acid and separation of the layer, the reaction yield is reduced upon accumulation of a large amount of neutral salts, but this reduction can be prevented by limiting the amount of the basic catalyst used in one reaction to the minimum amount for allowing the reaction to proceed.  \\n     [0018] According to the process of the present invention, a cycloalkanone and the aldehyde (2) containing the carboxylic acid (1) are used as the starting materials to produce the compound (3) stably in high yield and high selectivity regardless of the content of the carboxylic acid (1) in the aldehyde (2), and simultaneously the cycloalkanone can be effectively used thus reducing waste water thereby reducing an environmental impact. Further, the resulting compound (3) can be used to efficiently produce the compounds (7) and (8) useful as perfume materials and physiologically active substances.  \\n     [0019] [Process for Producing the Compound (3)] \\n     [0020] The cycloalkanone used in the process for producing the compound (3) in the present invention is cyclopentanone or cyclohexanone, preferably cyclopentanone. The aldehyde (2) is preferably an aldehyde wherein R 1  is preferably a C1 to C8 alkyl group, more preferably a C3 to C5 alkyl aldehyde. The aldehyde (2) is still more preferably an aldehyde (valeraldehyde) having a C4 linear alkyl group.  \\n     [0021] The aldehyde (2) used in the present invention contains its oxide i.e. the carboxylic acid (1). The method of quantifying the carboxylic acid (1) in the aldehyde (2) includes, for example, liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, titration, etc., but in consideration of convenience, acid value determined by titration is desirably used.  \\n     [0022] The basic catalyst used in the present invention is preferably a compound represented by formula (9):  \\n     M(OH) m \\u2003\\u2003(9)  \\n     [0023] wherein M is an alkali metal such as Li, Na and K or an alkaline earth metal such as Mg, Ca and Ba, preferably an alkali metal, and m is an integer of 1 or 2.  \\n     [0024] In the present invention, the amount (A) of the basic catalyst added is not less than the amount (B) of the carboxylic acid (1) contained in the aldehyde (2) (i.e., the amount (A) is not less than the equimolar amount of the carboxylic acid (1)), and the difference between A and B, that is, (A-B) is 0.06 mol or less, preferably 0 to 0.02 mol, more preferably 0.001 to 0.005 mol, per mol of the aldehyde (2), from the viewpoint of achieving good reaction rate and yield.  \\n     [0025] The amount (B) of the carboxylic acid (1) contained in the aldehyde (2) corresponds to the number of moles of KOH for the acid value (mg-KOH/g) of the aldehyde (2). That is, a required mole number of KOH is determined from the acid value (mg-KOH/g) of the aldehyde (2) and the amount of the aldehyde (2), and the basic catalyst in an amount of not less than the equimolar amount of the required mole number of KOH can be added to prevent a reduction in yield and selectivity. The difference between A and B (A-B); that is, the amount (A) of the basic catalyst added minus the amount (corresponding to B) of the basic catalyst reacting with the carboxylic acid (1)) is the amount of the basic catalyst effective for allowing the reaction to proceed, and (A-B) can be made 0.06 mol or less per mol of the aldehyde (2) to prevent formation of byproducts such as cycloalkanone dimers. Even if the aqueous layer is repeatedly used, high yield can be maintained.  \\n     [0026] Further, in the process of the present invention, the ratio by weight of added water to the cycloalkanone is preferably 0.2 to 1.2, more preferably 0.4 to 1.2, especially preferably 0.4 to 0.6, from the viewpoint of preventing formation of byproducts such as aldehyde (2) dimers, cycloalkanone dimers, and high-boiling components.  \\n     [0027] The cycloalkanone is reacted with the aldehyde (2) such that the molar ratio of the cycloalkanone to the aldehyde (2) is preferably 1 or more from the viewpoint of higher yield, more preferably 1.2 to 4.0, still more preferably 1.2 to 3.0, especially 1.5 to 2.7 mol, from the viewpoint of recovery of an excess of the cycloalkanone.  \\n     [0028] The reaction temperature of the aldol condensation is preferably \\u22125 to 40\\u00b0 C., more preferably \\u22125 to 30\\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of prevention of coagulation of the aqueous layer and prevention of formation of cycloalkanone dimers etc.  \\n     [0029] It is desired in the process of the present invention that the cycloalkanone, water and the basic catalyst are charged into a reactor, and while the mixture is kept at the reaction temperature described above, the aldehyde (2) is added dropwise thereto. The dropping time does not affect the yield, and may be changed depending on the temperature-controlling ability of the reactor. After the aldehyde (2) is added, aging reaction may be carried out if necessary to increase the degree of conversion. The aging time is not particularly limited, and as the time is increased, byproducts are gradually increased. In consideration of productivity, it is desired that the time of dropping the aldehyde (2) is about 1 to 8 hours, and the aging time is about 1 to 6 hours. This reaction is conducted preferably in an inert gas atmosphere. The inert gas includes nitrogen, argon, etc.  \\n     [0030] The pressure of the aldol condensation reaction, in terms of absolute pressure, is preferably 10 kPa to 1 MPa, more preferably 50 to 300 kPa, still more preferably more or less than 100 kPa.  \\n     [0031] Because the aldol condensation reaction is a reaction in a two-layer system of cycloalkanone and water, use of a solvent destroying this system is not preferable. The solvent used in the present invention is not particularly limited, provided that it is inert to the reaction system and does not hinder separation and purification of the product, and such solvents include those having a boiling point in the range of 140 to 210\\u00b0 C., such as aromatic hydrocarbon solvents (benzene, toluene, etc.) and aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents (nonane, decane, undecane, etc.).  \\n     [0032] Because the aqueous layer used in the aldol condensation reaction contains a large amount of the cycloalkanone, the aqueous layer is preferably separated and repeatedly used. Because a part of the aqueous layer is distributed in the oil layer, its corresponding amount of water and a basic catalyst may further be added in the reaction for repeated use. If necessary, they may further be added.  \\n     [0033] In the presence of the basic catalyst, separation of the layer may be time-consuming. In this case, the layer may be separated for repeated use after adjustment with an acid to pH at which the layer can be easily separated. When it is also necessary to recover the cycloalkanone by distillation from the oil layer after separation of the layer, the pH value is regulated desirably in the acidic range, preferably in the range of pH 4 to 7, in order to prevent decomposition of the compound (3).  \\n     [0034] The acid used here is not particularly limited, and general organic acids and inorganic acids can be used, but in respect of easy handling, costs, etc., the acid is preferably sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or condensed phosphoric acid.  \\n     [0035] When the acid is added, it is desirable to add, besides the above-described amount of the basic catalyst, the basic catalyst in such an amount as to neutralize or alkalize (to pH 7 or more) the aqueous layer in order to use the aqueous layer again in the reaction.  \\n     [0036] [Process for Producing the Compound (7)] \\n     [0037] Using the compound (3) obtained by the above process as the starting material, the compound (7) useful as a perfume material and a physiological activator can be obtained by a method described in e.g. JP-A 56-147740.  \\n     [0038] Specifically, the compound (3) is subjected to dehydration reaction with oxalic acid or the like to give compound (4) which is then subjected to isomerization reaction in the presence of an aqueous acid (hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid) in n-butanol under reflux to give the compound (5). Then, the compound (5) is reacted with the compound (6) in the presence of a basic catalyst to give a compound represented by formula (10) (referred to hereinafter as compound (10)):  \\n                 \\n \\n     [0039] wherein n, R 1  and R 2  have the same meaning as defined above.  \\n     [0040] The compound (6) is allowed to react, preferably in 1- to 5-molar excess, more preferably in 1.2- to 2-molar excess, with the compound (5).  \\n     [0041] The basic catalyst includes an alkali metal such as sodium and potassium and an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium alkoxide and potassium alkoxide. The catalyst is used in a molar ratio of preferably 0.005 to 0.2 to the compound (5). The solvent is preferably a polar solvent such as alcohol. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of \\u221210 to 30\\u00b0 C., more preferably in the range of 0 to 20\\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0042] Then, the resulting compound (10) can be reacted with water to produce the compound (7). Preferably, water is added dropwise to the reaction system in a molar ratio of 1 to 3 to the compound (10) during the reaction. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 150 to 250\\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0043] [Process for Producing the Compound (8)] \\n     [0044] Using the compound (3) obtained by the above process as the starting material, the compound (8) useful as a perfume material and a physiological activator can be obtained by a general method known in the art.  \\n     [0045] For example, the compound (3) is subjected to dehydration reaction in the same manner as in production of the compound (7) to give the compound (4), and the compound (4) is subjected to isomerization reaction in the same manner to give the compound (5). Then, the compound (5) is reduced with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd/C to give a compound represented by formula (11) (referred to hereinafter as compound (11)).  \\n                 \\n \\n     [0046] wherein n and R 1  have the same meaning as defined above.  \\n     [0047] The resulting compound (11) is subjected, for example, to Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with an oxidizing agent such as peracetic acid as described in JP-A 9-104681 to give the compound (8).  \\n     EXAMPLES  \\n     Example 1  \\n     [0048] Valeraldehyde having an acid value of 3.4 mg-KOH/g was used as the starting material. 117.6 g (1.4 mol) cyclopentanone, 125.2 g water and 2.8 g (0.033 mol) 48% NaOH were introduced into a 500-mL four-necked flask, then the mixture was cooled to 0\\u00b0 C. under stirring, and 72.4 g (0.84 mol) valeraldehyde was added dropwise at the same temperature over 4 hours. Thereafter, the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 4 hours. After the reaction was finished, the mixture was neutralized with 17.4 g of 10% sulfuric acid and the organic layer was analyzed by gas chromatography.

Typically, screens or grates having an arcuate shape are located beneath the hammer mill and have a plurality of openings that determine the ultimate size of the particulate that is produced by the machine. The openings are known to take on a variety of shapes and sizes, such as square, circular, triangular, hexagonal, octagonal, and so on. Typically, the overall grates span approximately 180 degrees, commonly requiring two or three removable abutting arcuate grates to span the 180 degrees. As shown in  FIG. 1  of the prior art, the grates are commonly initially formed having a continuous imperforate flat frame  1  around an outer perimeter. Once bent to a curve, one of the perimetrical frames  1  of one grate  2  abuts another perimetrical frame  1  of a mating grate  3  to establish a seam  4  between the mating grates  2 ,  3 . As a result, the seam  4  presents a continuous imperforate wall  5  that prevents throughput of ground particulate from the machine. Ultimately, by preventing or restricting throughput in the areas where abutting frame surfaces are created between mating grates, the potential throughput of ground particulate produced by the machine is reduced. To compensate for this, it is known to construct grates with webbing having a minimal material thickness in an attempt to provide either more openings or more open area within each opening, and thus, to gain more particulate throughput. Ultimately, a reduced web thickness reduces the useful life of the grates.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      A grate assembly constructed according to the present invention improves the throughput of wood particulate in a comminution apparatus. The grate assembly has at least two generally arcuate bodies, with each body having openings passing therethrough and having an outer perimeter. At least a portion of the outer perimeter of each body has a perforate edge surface. The perforate edge surface is arranged for mating engagement with the perforate edge surface of an adjacent body to define at least some of the openings through which wood particulate passes.  \\n      Another aspect of the invention includes forming a grate for a grate assembly including at least two of the grates and being used in a comminution apparatus that produces wood particulate. The steps include providing a sheet of steel having a predefined outer perimeter configuration and forming a plurality of openings having continuous peripheral surfaces through the sheet. Further, forming a discontinuous edge along at least a portion of the outer perimeter for mirrored mating engagement with another discontinuous edge on an abutting grate. Then, bending the sheet into a predefined arcuate shape.  \\n      Another aspect of the invention includes a method of assembling a grate assembly within a housing having curved support surfaces, the housing being part of a comminution machine that produces wood particulate. The steps include providing at least two generally arcuate rigid bodies each having a plurality of openings defined by continuous peripheral surfaces and an outer perimeter with at least one discontinuous edge surface. Further, placing at least two of the bodies in the housing in abutment with the curved surfaces and arranging the discontinuous edge surface of one of the bodies in mirrored mating engagement with the discontinuous edge surface of an adjacent one of the bodies to define a plurality enclosed openings between the adjacent bodies.  \\n      Some of the objects, features and advantages of the invention include a grate assembly that increases the amount of throughput of wood particulate in a comminution apparatus, provides an increased number of openings extending therethrough while having an increased lateral cross-sectional area through a webbing of each grate, improves the size consistency of the wood particulate, reduces the amount of material in constructing the grate assembly, reduces the overall weight of the grate assembly, is of relatively simple and economical design and manufacture and has an extended life in use. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      These and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and best mode, appended claims and accompanying drawings in which:  \\n       FIG. 1  is a plan view of a grate assembly before bending constructed according to the prior art;  \\n       FIG. 2  is a side elevation view of a tub grinder apparatus having a grate assembly constructed according to one presently preferred embodiment of the invention;  \\n       FIG. 3  is a view looking generally in the direction of arrow  3  in  FIG. 2  showing a hammer mill;  \\n       FIG. 4  is a plan view of the grate assembly of  FIG. 2  before bending;  \\n       FIG. 5  is an assembled perspective view of the grates with the hammer mill of  FIG. 3  removed;  \\n       FIG. 6  is an enlarged fragmentary view showing mating surfaces of the grates taken generally along line  6 - 6  of  FIG. 5 ; and  \\n       FIG. 7  is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of the encircled area  7  of  FIG. 4 . \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 2 , a comminution apparatus, represented here as a tub grinder  10 , has a pair of screens or grates  12 ,  13  ( FIGS. 5 and 6 ) constructed according to one presently preferred embodiment. The grates  12 ,  13  facilitate the throughput of ground wood chips or particulate, and ultimately enhance the efficiency of producing ground particulate. It should be recognized that though the grates  12 ,  13  are shown in a tub grinder  10 , that other comminution machinery may incorporate the grates  12 ,  13 , for example and without limitation, horizontal feed grinders, gravity feed grinders, and the like, which is operative to reduce coarse or unground material to a smaller size finished material.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 3 , a tub  14  of the tub grinder  10  has a generally cylindrical wall  16  that rotates relative to a stationary base or floor  18 . As the wall  16  rotates, the unground wood material, commonly in the form of used pallets (not shown), in the tub  14  is caused to move in the direction of wall rotation. As the unground material rotates, it is urged into contact with a rotating hammer mill  20 .  \\n      The hammer mill  20  is supported by an elongate shaft (not shown) within a housing  22  ( FIG. 5 ) for rotation with the shaft. As the hammer mill  20  rotates, a plurality of hammers  24  forcefully engage the unground wood material to cut or pulverize the material against an anvil  26  ( FIG. 3 ) typically supported by the floor  18  of the tub  14 . Upon the material being cut, the material falls against the grates  12 ,  13 , and the material that is of the desired finish size falls through openings  28  in the grates  12 ,  13  and onto a conveyor or auger  30  ( FIG. 2 ). The material that is too large, and thus unable to fit through the openings  28  is re-circulated by the rotating hammer mill  20  so that it can be further cut until it is of the desired size, thereby allowing it to pass through the openings  28 .  \\n      The grates  12 ,  13  are generally formed from a metallic material, and preferably are formed from steel. As best shown in  FIG. 4 , initially, the grates  12 ,  13  have a frame or body  32 ,  33  cut or stamped from a sheet of steel to define an outer perimeter  34 ,  35  of the bodies  12 ,  13 , respectively. The bodies  32 ,  33  then have the openings  28  formed through the thickness of the bodies  32 ,  33 . The openings  28  are preferably stamped or cut, such as by a laser, water jet, EDM, and the like, thereby defining webs or webbing  44  having a thickness (t) ( FIG. 7 ) outlining a continuous peripheral surface of each opening  28 . As shown in  FIG. 4 , the outer perimeters  34 ,  35  of the bodies  32 ,  33  have a pair of opposite ends  41 ,  43  terminating at a pair of opposite sides  36 ,  37 , respectively. At least one of the sides  36 ,  37  of each body  32 ,  33  has a discontinuous or partly open perforate edge surface  39  for mating engagement with one another in use. Upon forming the openings  28  within the bodies  32 ,  33 , the bodies  32 ,  33  are bent, preferably with the use of a press, to take on a predefined generally arcuate or curved mating shape ( FIGS. 5 and 6 ). The independent arcuate bodies  32 ,  33  are supported at their ends  41 ,  43  in the machine on complimentarily curved support surfaces  45  on which they rest and from which they may be separately removed. Additionally, the bodies  32 ,  33  are shown supported along their length (L) by complimentarily curved support surfaces  47  between the ends  41 ,  43 . Desirably, the bodies  32 ,  33  have solid imperforate ribs  48  for mating engagement and support against the support surfaces  47 .  \\n      As best shown in  FIG. 5 , the grates  12 ,  13  in the tub grinder  10  typically span one-half of the entire grate surface. An enlarged view of the mating perforate edge surfaces  39  is shown in  FIG. 6 , better showing a discontinuous seam  38  being defined between the mating and preferably mirrored discontinuous edge surfaces  39  of the abutting bodies  32 ,  33 . The mating perforate edge surfaces  39  generally mate across the thickness (t) and define openings  40  ( FIG. 5 ) preferably similar in shape and size to the openings  28  throughout each grate  12 ,  13 . As such, ground material or particulate of the desired size is free to pass through the composite openings  40  formed partly in each grate  12 ,  13  along the seam  38 , thereby improving the efficiency in producing ground particulate. In the prior art, ground material is obstructed by the imperforate wall  5  formed by the mating imperforate edges ( FIG. 1 ), thereby reducing the amount of ground material throughput of a comminution apparatus incorporating the prior art grates  2 ,  3 . Upon the material passing through the grates  12 ,  13 , it falls onto the pair of augers  30  preferably rotating in opposite directions so that the material is fed to a conveyor  42  ( FIG. 2 ). The conveyor  42  then feeds the ground material into a pile or elsewhere for further use.  \\n      The bodies  32 ,  33  of the grates  12 ,  13  are preferably manufactured from a metallic material such as steel, wherein the openings  28 ,  40  are defined by a web  44  of steel ( FIG. 7 ). Each opening  28 , except for those at the mating perforate edge surfaces  39 , is preferably formed as a fully enclosed opening by the web  44 . The majority of the openings  28  are shown here having a generally hexagonal shape, though it should be understood that other geometries are equally suitable, such as triangular, rectangular, square, circular, or the like, as desired in the application.  \\n      In establishing the openings  40  along the seam  38 , not only is the throughput of the ground material improved, but further design benefits can be achieved. For example, in having additional openings for ground material to pass through, the webs or webbing  44  surrounding each opening can be constructed having an increased cross-sectional thickness (t) without having to reduce the area presented by the openings  28  from that of the prior art, and thus the amount of throughput of ground material can be maintained. As such, the grates  12 ,  13  can be constructed having a more durable and long-lasting life in use. In addition, by eliminating the continuous edge  1  ( FIG. 1 ), the grates  12 ,  13  can be constructed having a reduced material content, thereby reducing weight, and lowering the material cost of the grates  12 ,  13 .  \\n      It is to be understood that other embodiments of invention which accomplish the same function are incorporated herein and are contemplated to be within the scope of any allowed claims. For example and without limitation, it should be recognized that shapes of the openings  28 ,  40  and sizes of the openings  28 ,  40  may be varied as desired to achieve the desired size of ground product. In addition, any number of grates may be constructed to abut one another, such as three mating grates commonly used in horizontal feed grinders.

Provided are medicaments for the treatment of infection by micro-organisms such as  S. aureus,  methods of manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of infection, pharmaceutical packs containing medicaments for the treatment of infection, and methods of treatment of the human or animal body for infection by said micro-organisms.  \\n      Multiple drug resistance (MDR) is an increasing problem amongst gram-positive bacteria (Banergee, S. N. et al. 1991, Am. J. Med. 91: 865-895; Shaberg, D. R. et al., 1991, Am. J. Med. suppl., 88: 72-75; Gaynes, R. P. et al., 1994, Infect. Dis. Clin. Pract., 6: 452-455), particularly in hospitals. In particular, methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MSA) and coagulase-negative  staphylococci  (CNS), particularly methicillin-resistant CNS, prove problematic, being resistant to all penicillins and cephalosporins. Resistance to other agents such as quinolones is widespread (Malabarta, A. et al., 1997, Eur. J. Med. Chem., 32: 459-478; Lewis, K., 1994, TIBS, 19: 119-123; Traub, W. H. et al., 1996, Chemotherapy, 42: 118-132). Treatment is typically effected using vancomycin or teicoplanin. However, resistance to these agents is spreading and so new therapies are needed. For example, Hubert S K et al., (J Clin Microbiol. 1999 November; 37(11):3590-3; PMID: 10523558) discusses  S. aureus  isolates with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin. It has also been fund that certain epidemic strains of MRSA, including EMRSA-15 (www.phls.org.uk, Public Health Laboratories, Colindale, UK), can give rise to subclones with increased resistance to vancomycin (Burnie J et al., Clin Infect Dis. 2000 September; 31(3):684-9; PMID: 11017816). It was hoped that linezolid would provide a much needed alternative to current therapies, but Tsiodras S. et al. (Lancet. 2001 Jul. 21; 358(9277):207-8; PMID: 11476839) have reported a clinical isolate of MRSA resistant to linezolid in a patient being treated with this antibiotic for dialysis associated peritonitis.  \\n      In addition administration of large quantities of such antibiotics to patients to effect treatment of infections, especially of infections which display resistance to the antibiotic(s) being administered, can be cytotoxic -and nephrotoxic and although helping to save the patient&#39;s life can result in severe side-effects.  \\n      The treatment and diagnosis of Staphylococcal infections is discussed widely in the prior art and particularly relevant publications include WO 98/01154, WO 99/50418, and EP 0786519. The causes of antibiotic resistance are also discussed in publications such as Allignet J. (Gene 1997 Nov. 20; 202(1-2):133-8; PMID: 9427556).  \\n      Thus there is a clear need for new and enhanced therapies for micro-organism, particularly  S. aureus,  infection.  \\n      The present inventors have now found that a particular combination of agents, namely an antibody (detailed below) having a novel antigen binding part and a glycopeptide antibiotic (such as vancomycin or teicoplanin), has a very surprising synergistic therapeutic effect\\u2014the therapeutic efficacy of the glycopeptide antibiotic is substantially enhanced when compared to its therapeutic efficacy when used alone. This is particularly the case when the micro-organism being treated is resistant to the glycopeptide antibiotic. Importantly, the present invention is able to effect treatment of fully vancomycin resistant and vancomycin intermediately resistant strains of  S. aureus  using vancomycin together with the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2. Nowhere in the prior art is it suggested that this might be achieved. The glycopeptide antibiotics work by affecting the bacterial cell wall. Other antibiotics such as the penicillins also affect the bacterial cell wall. However, the present inventors have found that their efficacy is not improved by using them with the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2. in particular, experiments have shown that the efficacy of flucloxacillin is not improved by using it with the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2. Bacteria resistant to flucloxacillin did not have their resistance reduced by using the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2.  \\n      According to the present invention there is provided an antibody having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an antigen binding fragment thereof. The antibody is encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 although of course the nucleotide sequence can be readily modified to e.g. optimise the codons for specific micro-organisms used to synthesise it or for other reasons as desired.  \\n      The antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 (also referred to as \\u201cAurograb\\u201d RTM) is a human genetic recombinant antibody. It binds to the immunodominant cell surface antigen, GrfA, a  staphylococcal  ABC transporter protein (WO 99/50418; Burnie J P et al., Infect Immun. 2000 June; 68(6):3200-9; PMID: 10816464). It was originally derived from patients who had recovered from  S. aureus  septicaemia and were producing antibodies to GrfA. It has intrinsic anti- staphylococcal  activity and shows synergy with vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo, against a wide range of  S. aureus  strains including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant MRSA. The antibacterial activity of the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2, both alone and in combination with glycopeptide antibiotics, is of significant benefit in the treatment of  S. aureus  infections.  \\n      Both human plasma-derived immunoglobulin (Ramisse F et al., J Infect Dis. 1993 October; 168(4):1030-3; PMID: 8376815) and rabbit hyperimmune antiserum raised against GrfA are protective in models of  staphylococcal  infections (see \\u201cExperiments\\u201d section below). Human recombinant antibodies specific for GrfA are protective in mouse models of MRSA infection. A particular amino acid sequence of GrfA, the epitope of SEQ ID NO: 3, was found to be frequently targeted by the humoral immune response in patients recovering from  S. aureus  septicaemia (Bumie J P et al., 2000 supra).  \\n      However, nowhere in the prior art is it suggested that the improved treatment of micro-organism infections such as  S. aureus  may be effected using a combination of a glycopeptide antibiotic such as vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin, and an anti-GrfA antibody, particularly not antibody specific to the epitope of SEQ ID NO: 3, and more particularly not the antibody having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.  \\n      Thus according to the present invention there is provided a medicament comprising a therapeutically effective quantity of a glycopeptide antibiotic and antibody specific against GrfA, particularly antibody specific against the epitope of SEQ ID NO: 3. Also provided are methods of manufacture of medicaments, pharmaceutical packs and methods of treatment all comprising or using same. The medicament may be for the treatment of  S. aureus  infection. The term \\u201ctreatment\\u201d as used herein means any treatment which is designed to cure, alleviate, remove or lessen the symptoms of, or prevent or reduce the possibility of contracting such an infection, and includes prophylaxis.  \\n      The GrfA protein, which is an ABC transporter protein, has been isolated and purified from  S. aureus,  but homologues which perform the same function in other organisms exist and they may be used as the target for therapy. Thus antibody can be prepared against a homolog of GrfA, produced by a micro-organism other than  S. aureus  and may be used together with a glycopeptide antibiotic to effect treatment of infection by the micro-organism in a patient. Examples of other micro-organisms in which treatment can be effected are other  Staphylococci,  particularly coagulase negative  Staphylococci,  such as  S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis  and  S. saprophyticus.  Infection by  Enterococci,  particularly  E. faecalis  and  E. faecium,  can also be treated, as can infection by  Corynebacteria  such as  C. jeikeium  and  C. xerosis.    \\n      The homolog of GrfA may have a sequence homology of at least 60%, for example at least 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 99.5% with GrfA. Sequence homologies are determined using the NCBI BLASTN (nucleotide sequence comparisons) or BLASTP (polypeptide comparisons) programs, Version 2.1.2, with default parameters. The NCBI BLAST programs is to be found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. The term sequence identity used herein refers to amino acid residues in optimally aligned sequences which match exactly at corresponding relative positions.  \\n      In organisms other than  S. aureus,  particularly other  Staphylococci,  the epitope (SEQ ID NO: 3) against which antibodies are raised and which are used as the basis for the treatment may remain the same.  \\n      Thus according to the present invention there is provided a medicament for the treatment of infection, particularly  S. aureus  infection, said medicament comprising a therapeutically effective quantity of a glycopeptide antibiotic and the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an antigen binding fragment thereof.  \\n      Also provided is a glycopeptide antibiotic and the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an antigen binding fragment thereof for use in a method of manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of infection.  \\n      In effecting a therapy against infection, particularly  S. aureus  infection, the glycopeptide antibiotic and antibody or antigen binding fragment may be administered to a patient separately or sequentially. Also provided according to the present invention is a pharmaceutical pack comprising a therapeutically effective quantity of a glycopeptide antibiotic and the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an antigen binding fragment thereof.  \\n      Also provided according to the present invention is the use of a glycopeptide antibiotic and the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an antigen binding fragment thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of infection, particularly  S. aureus  infection.  \\n      Also provided according to the present invention is a method of treating infection, particularly  S. aureus  infection, in a patient, comprising the step of administering to said patient a therapeutically effective quantity of a glycopeptide antibiotic and the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an antigen binding fragment thereof.  \\n      Glycopeptide antibiotics of particular usefulness in the present invention are vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin, although of course the present invention extends to other members of the family of glycopeptide antibiotics.  \\n      The term \\u201cantibody\\u201d in its various grammatical forms is used herein to refer to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antibody combig site or paratope. Such molecules are also referred to as \\u201cantigen binding fragments\\u201d of immunoglobulin molecules.  \\n      Illustrative antibody molecules are intact immunoglobulin molecules, substantially intact immunoglobulin molecules and those portions of an immunoglobulin molecule that contain the paratope, including those portions known in the art as Fab, Fab\\u2032, F(ab\\u2032)2, scFv and F(v).  \\n      The term \\u201cantibody combining site\\u201d refers to that structural portion of an antibody molecule comprised of a heavy and light chain variable and hypervariable regions that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) antigen.  \\n      As regards the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2, it may be readily modified to alter its amino acid sequence whilst presenting the same paratope and retaining its antigen binding specificity. Generally speaking, its structure is arranged (amino to carboxy terminal sequence) as a human immunoglobulin variable heavy domain (V H ) and variable light chain (V\\u03ba) covalently joined together by a linker and having a His carboxy-terminal sequence.  \\n      Each of the variable regions is comprised of the complement determining regions CDR 1 , CDR 2  and CDR 3 , and they are fundamental in defining the antigen binding specificity of the antibody, i.e. the paratope. The present inventors have found that of these regions, the CDR 3  part of the V H  region is the most important in defining antigen specificity. Further teachings about antibodies are widely available in the art, e.g. Harlow, E. and Lane, D., \\u201cUsing Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual\\u201d, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1998. With the common general knowledge about the paratope defining portions of an antibody combining site and the above teachings, a person skilled in the art is readily able to modify the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 to produce alternative antibodies with the same paratope and which enable one to achieve the same or similar therapeutic effect.  \\n      For example an antigen binding fragment of the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 may be readily prepared by simply removing one or more of the carboxy-termiinal His residues. Other examples of modifications include the graffing of the hypervariable (complement determining regions) of the antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 into variable framework regions different to those of SEQ ID NO: 2 such that the resultant antibody still has the same paratope (see e.g. EP 239400 and suchlike).  \\n      By \\u201cimproved treatment\\u201d is meant that a given quantity of a glycopeptide antibiotic has a greater therapeutic effect when administered to a patient together with the antibody of the present invention than when administered alone. Similarly, a desired therapeutic effect can be achieved in a patient with a smaller dosage of a glycopeptide antibiotic when administered to a patient together with the antibody of the present invention than when the glycopeptide antibiotic is administered alone. This is particularly the case when the micro-organism such as  S. aureus  is resistant to the glycopeptide antibiotic. This can be extremely useful in reducing any side effects of treatment.  \\n      By providing existing glycopeptide antibiotics with a \\u201csecond wind\\u201d and allowing them to be therapeutically effective against e.g.  S. aureus  infection, even when the  S. aureus  is resistant to them, the present invention provides medicaments and treatments whose safety and efficacy can be readily evaluated and which do not involve new classes of substances\\u2014the safety parameters for glycopeptide antibiotics are already well known and can be applied to the present invention. Similarly the use of antibodies as the other active ingredient in the present invention is a relatively simple safety issue. In particular, when the antibody is in the form of a recombinant antibody fragment derived from human antibody sequences, its immunogenicity will be extremely low. In addition the use of treatment regimes in which the antibody is administered over a very short time period (for example a few days) means that there is little opportunity for the patient&#39;s immune system to develop an immune response against it. Thus adverse hypersensitivity-type reactions caused by the production of antibody against the antibody of the present invention and the formation/deposition of immune complexes is very small.  \\n      The antibody of SEQ ID NO: 2 also has a number of specific advantages\\u2014it does not have the F C  portion which can trigger complement deposition and macrophage binding and hence is unlikely to cause inappropriate activation of the complement cascade which can cause inflammation and tissue damage.  \\n      By producing the antibodies of the present invention without the use of animal-derived products, the possibility of introducing human or animal infectious disease agents or oncogenes into patients can be avoided.  \\n      Treatment regimes and dosages of the medicaments of the present invention are described below, and modification of them will be readily apparent to a person skilled in the art, who in particular will be aware of treatment regimes used with the glycopeptide antibiotic and will be able to modify them appropriately. For example, simple dose-response assays can be readily used and results of treatment in mammalian models such as murine models can be simply extrapolated across to humans.  \\n    \\n    \\n      The present invention will be further apparent from the following description with reference to the accompanying FIGURE, which shows by way of example only forms of treatment of  S. aureus  infection.  \\n       FIG. 1  shows the pharmacokinetics of high doses of Aurograb.

Y-axis is \\u03bcg/ml of Aurograb in blood samples.  \\n    \\n    \\n     EXPERIMENTS  \\n      The experiments detailed below show that Aurograb (i.e. SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2), the human recombinant antibody fragment of the present invention specific against GrfA, has intrinsic anti- staphylococcal  activity in vitro and in murine  staphylococcal  infection and that it shows synergistic activity with glycopeptide antibiotics, particularly the broad spectrum glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.  \\n      The synergistic activity with glycopeptide antibiotics is manifested by: \\n          (1) a reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin in the presence of Aurograb in vitro and     (2) reduced organ colony counts in murine models of  S. aureus  infection, when, after challenge with  S. aureus,  a single dose of Aurograb (2 mg/kg) is given in conjunction with a single dose of vancomycin (6 mg/kg).        \\n\\n      Unless stated otherwise, all procedures detailed herein were performed using standard protocols and following manufacturer&#39;s instructions where applicable.

Human Study  \\n      For this study, Aurograb is given in conjunction with vancomycin to reduce the mortality and/or morbidity of patients with culture-confirmed deep-seated MRSA infection. This study is performed in three parts: \\n          i) A tolerance and dose ranging study in which cohorts of 3 patients with MRSA infection are given staged escalating doses of Aurograb, starting with a sub-therapeutic dose (0.1 mg/kg) and rising to 1 mg/kg b.d., during which each patient is carefully monitored for any adverse side effects.     ii) An interim, open, labelled study in which 5 patients with MRSA infection are given the anticipated therapeutic course of Aurograb, namely 1 mg/kg b.d. for 7 days, and carefully monitored for tolerance and pharmacokinetics. A preliminary assessment of efficacy can be made based on historical controls.     iii) A prospective, double blind, randomised phase II trial.        \\n\\n      2. Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Properties  \\n                           TABLE 1                                      Physical Form:   Aurograb is a white amorphous               freeze-dried powder which, on               solubilisation in water at 2 mg/mL,               yields a clear, colourless               solution.           Structural Formula:   Recombinant protein with the amino               acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:               1 - a human scFv, together with a               carboxy terminal histidine tag of               6 histidine amino acid residues.           Molecular Weight:   Monomer - 28.1 kDa - approximately               18% of the molecule exists               as a homodimer.           Characteristics:   A white powder or friable               solid. Hygroscopic           Acidity/Alkalinity:   Aurograb is set at pH 9.5 \\u00b1 0.2.                      \\n \\n      3. Formulation, Composition, Handling &amp; Storage  \\n      3.1 Formulation &amp; Composition  \\n      The complete composition of Aurograb is given in Table 2, below. It consists of lyophilised (freeze-dried) powder provided at 10 mg per vial. The drug is administered by resuspension of the powder in 5 mL sterile injectable water shortly prior to iv injection. No other solvent should be substituted for water as Aurograb is sensitive to pH fluctuations and has been especially formulated for resuspension in water.  \\n                           TABLE 2                               Quantity per                   ml after               reconstitution               Quantity per   with 5 mL       Names of ingredients   Aurograb vial   water   Function                  Aurograb   \\u200210 mg   \\u2003\\u20092 mg   Active                   Ingredient       Urea Ph Eur, BP, USP, JP   150 mg   \\u2002\\u200930 mg   Excipient       Arginine Ph Eur   174 mg   34.8 mg   Excipient                  \\n \\n      L-arginine and urea are present in order to maintain the pH balance of the formulation and ensure solubility of the Aurograb. Both are present in dosages which are considered safe for clinical intravenous administration. For example, a single dose of Aurograb (37.5 mL for 75 Kg patient body weight) contains 7.5 mmoles arginine. This is 26 times less than the maximum permitted daily dose of L-arginine when administered during the measurement of growth hormone levels in children (ABPI compendium, 1998-99). For urea, a single 35 mL dose of Aurograb contains 1.125 g urea. Again, this is much less than the 150 g urea maximum permitted daily dose of urea (this is the maximum dose indicated for the treatment of acute intracranial pressure via intravenous delivery\\u2014ABPI compendium, 1998-99).  \\n      3.2 Storage  \\n      The lyophilised drug is stored in glass vials at 4\\u00b0 C. in the dark. Overnight transport at ambient temperatures is acceptable. Avoid prolonged exposure to bright light or excessive humidity. No change in Aurograb activity after storage at 4\\u00b0 C. (3 months) has been observed.  \\n      After reconstitution with water, Aurograb must be stored at 4\\u00b0 C. and should be used within 14 hours. Activity will slowly deteriorate if left at room temperature.  \\n      3.3 Preparation and Administration  \\n      Aurograb, provided at 10 mg per vial, is administered by resuspension of the powder in 5 mL of sterile injectable water shortly prior to intravenous (iv) injection. An example human dose is 1 mg/lkg b.d. Sterile water is introduced directly into the vials via injection through the rubber cap with a hypodermic syringe/needle.  \\n      To reconstitute: \\n          add half the final volume of water (2.5 ml per vial) and swirl to dissolve filter (if necessary) to remove any undissolved material add the remaining water.        \\n\\n      NB. If administration delayed, store at 4\\u00b0 C. (for up to 14 hours).  \\n      No other solvent should be substituted for water as Aurograb is sensitive to pH fluctuations and has been especially formulated for resuspension in water.  \\n      Aurograb should be administered by slow iv bolus injection, for example through an iv giving set which should be flushed first with saline to remove traces of any other iv fluids and then again after administration of the drug.  \\n      No special precautions are required for the clean-up of spills or waste disposal.  \\n      Saline for iv use is compatible with reconstituted Aurograb (at a 50:50 dilution). It is less compatible with 20% glucose and sodium bicarbonate buffer, as shown by a reduction in ELISA activity, and therefore if being given via the same iv giving set as these or other fluids, the injection port must be flushed through with saline before and after administrating the Aurograb.  \\n      4. Non-Clinical Studies  \\n      Aurograb shows antibacterial activity, both in vitro and in vivo, against a wide range of  S. aureus  strains. In addition Aurograb has been shown to exert a synergistic antibacterial effect when used in conjunction with vancomycin.  \\n      4.1 Non-Clinical Efficacy Studies: In Vitro Data  \\n      Aurograb shows synergistic activity in combination with vancomycin against a wide range of MRSA strains, including strains of EMRSA with intermediate resistance to vancomycin (\\u201cVISA\\u201d\\u2014vancomycin insensitive MRSA)  \\n      These data were prepared using the same MIC methodology routinely applied to antibiotics.  \\n      Aims: To demonstrate synergy when used in combination with vancomycin, against a wide range of epidemic strains of MRSA.  \\n      Objective: Synergy is demonstrated by a reduction in the MIC of vancomycin when Aurograb is used in combination.  \\n      Introduction  \\n      Epidemic strains of MRSA readily give rise to sub-population of intermediate resistance to vancomycin (i.e. MIC of 4 or 8 \\u03bcg/ml) by serial passage in nutrient broth with increasing concentrations of vancomycin (Burnie J et al., Clin Infect Dis. 2000 September; 31(3):684-9; PMID: 11017816). These are probably responsible for many of the treatment failures associated with vancomycin therapy. In this study Aurograb activity was examined against both these VISA and the fully vancomycin-sensitive parent EMRSA- 15 strain.  \\n      Method  \\n      Strains of MRSA were grown overnight in nutrient broth and diluted to give an inoculum of 1\\u00d710 3  cells per mL. 100 \\u03bcl aliquots of culture were placed into flat-bottomed microtitre plates and vancomycin added in the range 0.125-250 \\u03bcg/ml. Cultures were incubated for a further 2 days. The minimum growth-inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the highest concentration of antibiotic at which no bacterial growth occurs and is determined by spectrophotometric evaluation of the lack of turbidity (growth) in culture. MICs were determined in the presence of exogenous Aurograb or in the presence of Aurograb formulation buffer (negative control).  \\n      Results:  \\n                   TABLE 3                           MIC to Vancomycin in the           presence of Aurograb at the       MRSA Strain   following concentrations                                                    VISA:-   0 \\u03bcg/ml   60 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2002\\u200980 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2003\\u2009125 \\u03bcg/ml       EMRSA-1   8 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2002\\u20094 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2003\\u20092 \\u03bcg/ml   &lt;0.125 \\u03bcg/ml       EMRSA-2   4 \\u03bcg/ml   0.5 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2003\\u20091 \\u03bcg/ml   &lt;0.125 \\u03bcg/ml       EMRSA-8   8 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2002\\u20092 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2003\\u20091 \\u03bcg/ml   &lt;0.125 \\u03bcg/ml       EMRSA-11   4 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2002\\u20094 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2003\\u20091 \\u03bcg/ml   &lt;0.125 \\u03bcg/ml       EMRSA-12   8 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2002\\u20094 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2003\\u20092 \\u03bcg/ml   &lt;0.125 \\u03bcg/ml       EMRSA-15   8 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2002\\u20094 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2003\\u20092 \\u03bcg/ml   &lt;0.125 \\u03bcg/ml       Parent   1 \\u03bcg/ml   \\u2014   0.25 \\u03bcg/ml   &lt;0.125 \\u03bcg/ml       EMRSA-15                  \\n \\n      Spectrum of Activity: Enhanced antibacterial activity is evident in all strains tested demonstrating a broad spectrum of activity against strains of MRSA.  \\n      Synergy: Aurograb has the ability to increase the sensitivity of MRSA to vancomycin, including MRSA with reduced sensitivity to vancomycin.  \\n      Further experiments were undertaken to determine the MIC of vancomycin for a number of MRSA strains and the effect of the Aurograb antibody on MIC. The experiments were also performed using flucloxacillin instead of vancomycin to investigate how the efficacy of penicillin-type antibodies was affected by Aurograb. Results are given in Table 3a:  \\n                                               MIC to       EMRSA       vancomycin + 100 \\u03bcg/ml       strain   MIC to vancomycin   Aurograb                                                1   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       2   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       3   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       4   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       5   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       6   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.0125   \\u03bcg/ml       7   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       8   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.0125   \\u03bcg/ml       9   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.0125   \\u03bcg/ml       10   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       11   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       12   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       13   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       14   0.25 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       15   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml       16   \\u20020.5 \\u03bcg/ml   0.03   \\u03bcg/ml                  \\n \\n      Results obtained with flucloxacillin showed that the MIC obtained was &gt;256 \\u03bcg/ml for all EMRSA strains. Flucloxacillin+Aurograb gave the same results and showed no decrease in the MIC of flucloxacillin.  \\n      Conclusion: Use of Aurograb in combination with vancomycin should both increase therapeutic efficacy and impede the emergence of vancomycin resistant strains. Due to the stnucture and function of the antibody with respect to the target molecule, similar results can be expected to be achieved using other glycopeptide antibiotics such as teicoplanin, the resistance mechanisms employed by  S. aureus  against them being the same as for vancomycin and therefore also being a target for the antibody and being susceptible to therapy using it.  \\n      4.2 Non-Clinical Efficacy Studies: In Vivo Data  \\n      The murine model of  staphylococcal  infection is widely used and is routinely used in the assessment of antimicrobial drugs. It is a good predictor of efficacy in infected humans since  S. aureus  is introduced intravenously to create a bacteraemia, from which the pathogen spreads to other organs, including the kidney, liver and spleen. Hence the nature of the infection (septicaemia) is analogous to the situation in infected patients. Also, the intravenous route of administration of Aurograb, used in the animal models (data given below) is the same route as that typically to be used in patients, improving the chances of comparable pharmacokinetics, drug bio-availability and efficacy.  \\n      Data Set 1: Aurograb\\u2014Intrinsic Antibacterial Activity Against EMRSA-15  \\n      Aims: To demonstrate Aurograb is therapeutic when given alone in mice infected with a vancomycin-sensitive strain of MRSA, the EMRSA-15.  \\n      Objective: Anti- staphylococcal  activity is demonstrated by a reduction in mortality or a reduction in bacterial load (colony forming units) in kidney, liver or spleen in the presence of Aurograb.  \\n      Method: 20 female CD-1 mice were given a sub-lethal challenge (1.3\\u00d710 7  cfu) of a methicillin-resistant, vancomycin-sensitive strain of  S. aureus  (EMRSA-15, Typed Hospital Isolate, Central Manchester Healthcare Trust) in 100 \\u03bcl iv bolus (all iv injections given via the lateral tail vein). 1 hour later, two groups of 10 mice, received, as 100 \\u03bcl iv bolus:\\u2014\\n          1. formulation buffer (Arginine-Urea), as negative control or     2. Aurograb (2.0 mg/kg) in formulation buffer.        \\n\\n      All animals were sacrificed after a further 48 h and viable cfu per gram of organ were determined.  \\n      Results:  \\n                               TABLE 4                                      Kidney   Liver   Spleen                         Group (n = 10)   Aurograb   Log cfu/g tissue                                         1.

Administration of Aurograb resulted in a log (10 fold) reduction in viable organisms found in all three organs. This suggests that Aurograb reduces the viability of  S. aureus  in experimental infections of mice in the absence of any other exogenous antimicrobial using the murine model of deep-seated infection.  \\n      Data Set 2: Aurograb Dose Ranging Study  \\n      Aims: Dose ranging study for use of Aurograb versus  S. aureus  strain EMRSA-15.  \\n      Objective: Antibacterial activity is demonstrated by the greater reduction in bacterial load (organ cfu) in kidney, liver or spleen when Aurograb is given, as a single agent, compared to the placebo control. Dose range is determined by comparing cfu (expressed as the log of the cfu per gram of tissue) for different organs at different doses.  \\n      Method: 40 female CD-1 mice (24-26 g) challenged with iv bolus of  S. aureus  followed 2 hours later by single iv dose of placebo or Aurograb (2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg). All mice terminated at 48 hours for culture of kidney, liver and spleen to determine organ viability counts.  \\n      Results: expressed as log cfu per gram of tissue  \\n      Experiment 1  \\n       S. aureus  (1.5\\u00d710 7  cfu): EMRSA-15  \\n                           TABLE 5                       Aurograb dose   Kidney   Liver   Spleen                  \\u2002\\u20090   \\u20028.40 \\u00b1 2.256   7.22 \\u00b1 2.52   6.98 \\u00b1 2.39       \\u2002\\u20092 mg/kg   7.62 \\u00b1 1.16   5.22 \\u00b1 1.39   5.10 \\u00b1 1.29       \\u2002\\u20091 mg/kg   8.7 \\u00b1 2.6   5.40 \\u00b1 1.38   5.33 \\u00b1 1.21       0.2 mg/kg   \\u20028.5 \\u00b1 2.55   6.61 \\u00b1 3.03   5.69 \\u00b1 1.16                    \\n      Experiment 2  \\n       S. aureus  (9\\u00d710 6  cfu): clinical isolate EMRSA-15\\u2014low dose Aurograb  \\n                                   TABLE 6                                   Aurograb dose   Kidney   Liver   Spleen                          0.2 mg/kg   7.14 \\u00b1 1.28   3.13 \\u00b1 0.44   3.40 \\u00b1 0.64           Aurograb           Placebo 1     7.36 \\u00b1 1.05   4.14 \\u00b1 1.27   4.01 \\u00b1 1.26                           1 Negative control antibody (WC7) specific to a non-protective epitope of GrfA.               \\n      Experiment 1: a 10 to 100 fold reduction in viable bacteria for liver and spleen was achieved in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg Aurograb. At 0.2 mg/kg Aurograb, clearance from the spleen is still good, but reduced in the liver. The highest dose resulted in a 0.8 log reduction in kidney bacterial counts but no reduction occurred with the lower doses.  \\n      Experiment 2: At doses as low as 0.2 mg no reduction in viable  staphylococci  is evident in the kidneys, but there is evidence of bacterial killing in the liver and spleen.  \\n      Conclusion: Administration of Aurograb at 2 mg/kg results in a reduction in viable organisms found in all three organs, but particularly the spleen and liver. Aurograb at a dose of 1 mg/kg also showed significant antibacterial activity in the spleen and liver, but lost activity in the kidney. Doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg, still showed antibacterial activity in the spleen, and to a lesser extent, the liver.  \\n      Extrapolation to humans: A single dose of 2.0 mg/kg in mice gave an approximately 2.0 log drop in liver and spleen counts and a 0.8 log drop in kidney counts. This equates, on a body weight basis, to 1 mg/kg given twice daily to humans.  \\n      Data Set 3: Aurograb Antibacterial Activity and Synergy With Vancomycin: Sub-Lethal Model.  \\n      Aims: To demonstrate Aurograb is antibacterial when given alone and synergistic when given in conjunction with vancomycin in mice infected with a sublethal dose of  S. aureus.    \\n      Objective: Antibacterial activity is demonstrated by a reduction in bacterial load (colony forming units) in kidney, liver or spleen in the presence of Aurograb alone. Synergy is demonstrated by a greater reduction in organ colony counts when Aurograb and vancomycin are given together than when either antibacterial is given alone.  \\n      Methods: 60 female CD-1 mice (22-24 g) were given 1 x 107 cfu of EMRSA-15 as a 100 \\u03bcl iv bolus. 2 hours later, in groups of 10 mice, they received, as a single 100 \\u03bcl iv bolus: \\n          Group 1\\u20146.0 mg/kg vancomycin+2.0 mg/kg Aurograb     Group 2\\u20146.0 mg/kg vancomycin+0.2 mg/kg Aurograb     Group 3\\u20146.0 mg/kg vancomycin+placebo (formulation buffer)     Group 4\\u2014placebo+2.0 mg/kg Aurograb     Group 5\\u2014placebo+0.2 mg/kg Aurograb     Group 6\\u2014placebo+2.0 mg/kg Aurograb        \\n\\n      All mice were terminated at 48 hours for culture of kidney, liver and spleen.  \\n      Results: expressed as log cfu per gram of tissue, unless the majority of mice (&gt;5) were cleared (ie organs were culture-negative).

Renal clearance was better with vancomycin than Aurograb, although none of the mice were cleared of renal infection.  \\n      Synergy Mice (group 1) receiving 2.0 mg/kg of Aurograb plus vancomycin (6 mg/kg) showed complete clearance of  staphylococci  from the livers of all 10 mice, and enhanced clearance from the spleens, being culture negative in 9 mice, compared to 4-5 being cleared by Aurograb or vancomycin alone and 1 being cleared in the untreated group. Renal colony counts in those receiving combination therapy (group 1) were reduced by an additional 0.5 log compared to mice receiving vancomycin alone (group 3), and reduced by 1.6 log compared to negative control mice (group 6). This demonstrates the synergy between Aurograb and vancomycin.  \\n      Data Set 4: Aurograb Synergy With Vancomycin: Lethality Model  \\n      Aims: To demonstrate Aurograb is antibacterial when given alone and synergistic when given in conjunction with vancomycin in mice infected with a lethal dose of  S. aureus.    \\n      Objective: Antibacterial activity is demonstrated by a reduction in mortality with Aurograb alone. Synergy is demonstrated by a greater reduction in mortality when Aurograb is given in combination with vancomycin, rather-than vancomycin alone.  \\n      Method: 60 female CD-1 mice (22-24 g) were given  S. aureus  (a fresh clinical isolate of EMRSA-15) at a dose of 8\\u00d710 7  cfu in a 100 \\u03bcl iv bolus. 2 hours later, in groups of 10 mice, they received, as a single 100 \\u03bcl iv bolus: \\n          Group 1\\u20144.0 mg/kg vancomycin+2.0 mg/kg Aurograb     Group 2\\u20144.0 mg/kg vancomycin     Group 3\\u20142.0 mg/kg vancomycin+2.0 mg/kg Aurograb     Group 4\\u20142.0 mg/kg vancomycin     Group 5\\u20142.0 mg/kg Aurograb     Group 6\\u2014placebo        \\n\\n      All mice were terminated at 48 hours for culture of kidney, liver and spleen.

Administration of Aurograb alone (2.0 mg/kg) was associated with a reduction in mortality (4 deaths) compared to the untreated group (7 deaths), comparable to the mortality on vancomycin alone (6 and 5 deaths). This suggests that Aurograb has comparable intrinsic anti- staphylococcal  activity to vancomycin at 4.0 mg/kg.  \\n      Synergy: Mice receiving combination therapy (Aurograb 2.0 mg/kg and vancomycin 4.0 mg/kg) had higher rates of survival than with vancomycin or Aurograb alone suggesting a synergistic effect with the two drugs.  \\n      5. Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Animals  \\n      5.1 Pharmacokinetics  \\n      The pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of Aurograb have been studied in mice. A murine model was used because efficacy and dose ranging studies have been performed in this species as were the repeat dose toxicology studies. Mice were given a single high dose as an iv bolus and then examined in duplicate for blood levels and organ distribution. Urine samples were also analysed. Samples were analysed for functional activity, measured by ELISA (blood samples only) and drug concentration (SDS PAGE/immunoblots).  \\n      Results  \\n      Results are shown in  FIG. 1 . Mice given a single intravenous bolus injection of Aurograb (10 mg/kg) showed satisfactory blood levels.  \\n      All organs (lungs, brain, liver, spleen, heart, kidney and blood) were cleared by 24 hours.  \\n      6.2 Blood Compatibility Study  \\n      This study was carried out by Biochemical Pharmacology department at Inveresk Research, Scotland, in order to assess the suitability of Aurograb for intravenous administration.  \\n      Blood samples were taken from healthy human volunteers, transferred to tubes containing Aurograb, Aurograb vehicle, saponin or saline and incubated at 37\\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. After centrifugation, the amount of haemoglobin in the supernatant was then assessed to determine haemolysis. According to the American Society for Testing and Materials classification system (ASTM F756-93, 1993) the data indicated that 0.1 mg/ml Aurograb and the Aurograb vehicle were non-haemolytic. This compared with physiological saline which was non-haemolytic, and in total contrast to the positive reference compound (saponin) which was found to be severely haemolytic.  \\n      7 Manufacture of Aurograb Antibody  \\n      7.1 Introduction  \\n      Aurograb is produced in E.coli in the form of inclusion bodies. The isolation, solubilisation, denaturation and refolding of inclusion bodies has been previously well documented (see \\u2018Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual\\u2019. Harlow, E. and Lane, D. 1988. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; \\u2018Inclusion bodies and purification of proteins in biologically active forms\\u2019. Mukhopadhyay, A. 1997. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol.; 56:61-109). An example of such a procedure is outlined in this application. Briefly, inclusion bodies were extracted from the cell mass, solubilised/denatured, refolded and purified using chromatography. Over expression of Aurograb is from the powerfilw T7 promoter in vector pET29b (Novagen). The cell mass is produced as a quality controlled, pure culture prepared in a sterile fermenter (1000 L) using media free of animal products. The  E.coli  strain used is genetically disabled (unable to colonise/persist in the environment) and is avirulent. Impurities removed during downstream processing are thus (1)  E.coli  host cell proteins (HCPs) (2)  E.coli  pyrogens (mainly endotoxin) (3) fermentation additives (antibiotics) (4) downstream processing additives (buffers and NiSO 4 ).  \\n      Large amounts of contaminants from  E.coli  and virtually all fermentation media derived contaminants are removed during the process extraction of the protein from inclusion bodies. For this, the cell mass is isolated by centrifugation and broken using a micro fluidiser. The Aurograb inclusion bodies are separated from the cell mass by three centrifugation-resuspension- micro fluidisation steps thereby washing the inclusion bodies extensively. Inclusion bodies are solubilised and refolded over a two day period in the presence of copper chloride, which serves as an oxidation catalyst, thus establishing the correct and biologically active structure of the Aurograb molecule. Extensive diafiltration is performed to remove small molecules from the refolding reaction and trace residual kanamycin (from the fermentation reaction). Remaining host cell proteins are removed by immobilised nickel-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and anion exchange. In particular, endotoxin, which is a significant safety issue for drugs manufactured from  E.coli,  is efficiently removed during IMAC by the addition of deoxycholic acid. The last traces of  E.coli  HCP are removed during the anion exchange step. Traces of nickel from the IMAC step are removed using a nickel affinity column. Finally small molecules from the chromatography buffer system are removed using diafiltration against formulation buffer. The bulk product is lyophilised in vials for use in patients. The numbered paragraphs below specifically detail the manufacture of the Aurograb antibody.  \\n      7.2 Aurograb Manufacturing Protocol  \\n      Fermentation and downstream processing were performed using a total of nine steps as follows: \\n          1. Fermentation     2. Harvest and isolation of inclusion bodies     3. Refolding     4. Concentration and diafiltration     5. Filtration and sterile filtration     6.

Purification\\u2014Anion exchange chromatography     9. Diafiltration and bulk filling        \\n\\n      7.3 Fermentation  \\n      A frozen stock of the Aurograb expressing  E. coli  (Clone JM109 (DE3)(pSaABC4)) was inoculated into 4\\u00d7500 ml glass conical flasks, to prepare the inoculum prior to transfer to a 1000 L stirred fermenter (MBR). The precultures (supplemented with kanamycin) were incubated at 37\\u00b0 C. with shaking, for 15-20 h, until the preculture OD 578 =4.0-8.0, representing 7-8 cell divisions. At production scale, the precultures were transferred into a 1000 L fermenter (MBH) containing 1000 L nutrient broth. The production culture was incubated at 37\\u00b0 C. for a total of 14-18 h, representing 7 cell divisions. Approximately 10-13 h post inoculation, when the OD 578 =5-8, the production culture was induced through the addition of 23.8 g IPTG (100 \\u03bcM).  \\n      7.4 Harvest and Isolation of Inclusion Bodies  \\n      Cells were harvested by centrifligation (4 h post induction) at 12,800 g in an Alfa Laval BTPX 205 centrifge with a flow rate of approx. 400 L/h. The harvested  E. coli  cell paste was stored at \\u221250\\u00b0 C. in PE bags Kendro). The down stream processing of 100% cell paste mass from a single fermentation batch having been stored at \\u221250\\u00b0 C. constituted a single purification batch. The cell paste was thawed and resuspended in 1000 L lysis buffer. The resuspended bacterial cells were subjected to high pressure homogenisation (APV Gaulin MC1 5) at ca. 1000 bar (15,000 psi) with a flowrate ca. 500 L/h. The inclusion bodies were sedimented by centriflugation at ca. 12.800 g with a flowrate ca. 400 L/h. The inclusion bodies were then washed with 400 L of lysis buffer, and sedimented by centrifugation at ca. 12.800 g with a flowrate ca. 400 L/h, for a total of three times. The washed inclusion bodies were stored as a slurry at \\u221270\\u00b0 C. prior to the refolding step. The inclusion bodies were solubilised by strong agitation for 5-10 minutes in 40 L 6M urea/100 mM Tris pH 12.5 at room temperature.  \\n      7.5 Refolding  \\n      For refolding the inclusion body solution was made up to 560 L with refolding buffer, and CuCl 2 .2 H 2 O was added to a final concentration of 100 \\u03bcM. The preparation was incubated for 48 h at 2-8\\u00b0 C. under strong agitation. The inclusion bodies were filtered (Sartorius GF 30\\u2033, 3.0/0.8 \\u03bcm) and then filter sterilised (Seitz Supradisc SDPEK 1, depth filter).  \\n      7.6 Concentration and Diafiltration  \\n      Concentration and diafiltration steps were carried out using cassettes (15 m 2 ) of omega screen channel with a 10kDa cutoff (Pall) housed in a \\u201cCentrasette\\u201d stainless steel holder (Pall), under the control of a 1000 membrane piston pump (pump quattro). The refolded protein preparation was concentration to 150 L, followed by diafiltration with 3000 litres of 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 9.5. The preparation was adjusted to 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM DCA, 1 M NaCl and made up to a final volume of 300 L with RO water. The diafiltered refold was stored over night at 2-8\\u00b0 C. The pH was then adjusted to 8.0 through the addition of HCl.  \\n      7.7 Filtration Steps and Sterile Filtration  \\n      The diafiltered refold was filtered (Seitz Supradisc SDPEK1, depth filter) and then filter sterilised (Millipore Opticap 10\\u2033, 0.2 \\u03bcm). The sterile product was stored at 2-80\\u00b0 C.  \\n      7.8 Immobilised Ni 2+  Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)  \\n      The IMAC step was performed in a BPG300/500 column (Amersham Pharmacia). Sterilisation of chromatography columns took place during resin cleaning in place (CIP). IMAC chromatography resin (18 L) was initally charged with 2 column volumes (CV) 100 mM NiSO 4 .6H 2 O. Chromatography utilised 5.5 (CV) equilibration buffer (IMAC A); 5.5 CV Wash buffer I (IMAC B); 3.3 CV Wash buffer II (IMAC C); 5.5 CV Elution buffer (IMAC D). Fractions collected from the eluate were filter sterilised (Millipore Opticap 10\\u2033, 0.2 \\u03bcm) and stored overnight at 2-8\\u00b0 C.  \\n      7.9 Nickel Removal Chromatography  \\n      Nickel removal chromatography was performed in a BPG140/500 column (Amersham Pharmacia) using 2 L chelating Sepharose resin. The column was equilibrated and washed with 5 CV buffer (IMAC D) and the Aurograb antibody containing solution was applied, the column was washed with 2CV anion/conditioning buffer (50 mM Tris, 6 M urea pH 8.7) and the eluate was retained prior to anion exchange chromatography.  \\n      7.10 Anion Exchange Chromatography  \\n      The Anion exchange chromatography step was performed in a BPG300/500 column (Amersharm Pharmacia) using 18 L resin (Q-Sepharose FF). The column was equilibrated using equilibration buffer and then anion/conditioning buffer. The Aurograb antibody containing solution was applied, washed with 2CV anion/conditioning buffer, and the flow through was filter sterilised (Millipore Opticap 10\\u2033, 0.2\\u03bcm) and stored overnight at 2-8\\u00b0 C.  \\n      7.11 Diafiltration and Bulk Filling  \\n      The pH of the sterile flow through (containing the Aurograb antibody) was adjusted to 9.5, and was then diafiltered against 10 turnover volumes (TOV) 10 mM ammonium acetate; 0.5 M urea, pH 9.5. There followed another diafiltration step, against 5 TOV 0.5 M urea, 0.2 M arginine pH 9.5. The protein was concentrated to 2 mg/ml, filter sterilised (Millipore Opticap 10\\u2033, 0.2 \\u03bcm) into a Stedim bag, and stored at 2-8\\u00b0 C.  \\n      7.12 Composition of Buffers, Media and Solutions  \\n      Growth Media  \\n      Media were monitored for microbial contamination prior to inoculation.

Determination of Synergistic Effect of Aurograb With Vancomycin  \\n      8.1 Method  \\n      In order to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (SHC), the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) and the FIX (fractional inhibitory index), the following was method was used.  \\n      Representatives of each of the most common EMRSA strains, a number of vancomycin resistant subpopulations, and three Linzolid resistant strains were grown overnight in nutrient broth. The cells were diluted in Isosensitest Broth (Oxoid, UK) to give a final inoculum of 1\\u00d710 3  cells per mL. 100 \\u03bcl aliquots of culture were placed into flat-bottomed microtitre plates and vancomycin added in the range 0.125-250 \\u03bcg/ml. To this was added exogenous Aurograb in the range 0.3-25 \\u03bcg/ml in a checkerboard formation. A negative control series was also prepared containing Aurograb formulation buffer alone. Cultures were incubated for 48 hours at 37\\u00b0 C.  \\n      The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of agent at which no bacterial growth occurred and was determined by spectrophotometric evaluation of the lack of turbidity (growth) in culture. This optical clearing was equivalent to &gt;99%  Staphylococcal  death.  \\n      8.2 Results  \\n      MIC values were obtained for vancomycin and Aurograb (RTM) alone and in combination. Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FIC) and FIX values were calculated. Synergistic activity between the two agents was defined as an FIX value \\u22670.5. Indifferent activity was defined as a value of 0.5-4, and a value of \\u22674 defined antagonism.  \\n      Results of the experiment are given below in Tables 9 and 10. VAN indicates vancomycin. The MIC (Alone) column indicates the minimum inhibitory concentration of the agent when administered alone. The MIC (In combination) column indicates the minimum inhibitory concentration of each drug when used in combination.  \\n      8.3 Conclusions  \\n      As can be seen from Tables 9 and 10, the administration of Aurograb with vancomycin results in a synergistic therapeutic effect being achieved, with MIC levels being substantially reduced, which in turn indicates that therapy of patients can be effected with lower dosages of antibiotics and to greater therapeutic effect, with an expected reduction in possible side-effects resulting from the antibiotic. The results indicae that even in cases where a patient is infected with a vancomycin-resistant  S. aureus  they may be successfully treated with the antibody of the present invention and its use in combination with antibiotics such as vancomycin may enable effective therapy at previously ineffectual non-toxic dosage levels of antibiotic.  \\n                           TABLE 9

 \\n       FIG. 2  depicts a brake incorporated in an embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 3  depicts a set of brake shoes incorporated in the brake shown in  FIG. 2 ;  \\n       FIG. 4  is a view of section AA of a brake shoe depicted in  FIG. 3 ;  \\n       FIG. 5  is a view of section BB of a brake shoe shown in  FIG. 3 ;  \\n       FIG. 6  is a section view of a brake incorporated in an alternative embodiment of the energy conversion system;  \\n       FIG. 7  is a plan view of a manifold incorporated in the brake shown in  FIG. 6 ; and,  \\n       FIG. 8  is a section view of the manifold in the brake depicted in  FIG. 6 .  \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION  \\n       FIG. 1  is a schematic representation of a first embodiment of an energy-converting brake system  10  in accordance with the present invention. The system  10  comprises a brake  12  having a braking surface  14  and a friction surface  16 , these surfaces being selectively moveable into contact with each other to produce a braking effect. In this regard, the friction surface  16  rotates relative to the braking surface  14 . The brake  12  further comprises a cooling circuit  18  through which a brake cooling fluid flows. The cooling circuit  18  is thermally coupled with the braking surface  14  so that heat generated by the mutual contact of the braking surface  14  with the friction surface  16  is transferred to the brake cooling fluid. In this regard the cooling circuit includes a portion  20  forming part of the braking surface  14 . The brake cooling fluid passes through a heat exchanger  22  which also comprises a thermoelectric conversion device  26 . Heat from the cooling fluid is dissipated in the heat exchanger  22  through the thermoelectric conversion device  26 . The transfer of heat through the device  26  results in the device  26  generating an electric current. Thus, the system  10  is able to generate electrical energy from the heat (thermal) energy produced by the brake  12 .  \\n      The device  26  is thermally coupled between the brake cooling fluid and a cooling medium that passes through or is thermally coupled with the heat exchanger  22 . In a preferred embodiment, the cooling medium is a second fluid that flows through a fluid cooling circuit  24 . A portion of the fluid cooling circuit  24  extends through the heat exchanger  22 . Accordingly, the heat transfer within the system  10  is as follows. Heat is produced by friction rising from the contact of the braking surface  14  with a friction surface  16 . Thus, heat is transferred to the brake cooling fluid, which is circulated by the brake cooling circuit  18  to the heat exchanger  22 . Heat from the brake cooling fluid is dissipated through the device  26  to the second fluid. The transfer of heat across the device  26  generates an electric current.  \\n      The system  12  can further comprise an electric storage device such as a capacitor  28  for storing electrical energy associated with the electric current. A further electric circuit (not shown) can be used to control the discharge of the capacitor  28  for the purposes of providing controlled use of the stored electrical energy. In one embodiment described hereinafter in greater detail, this current may be used to drive an electric engine of a hybrid vehicle incorporating the brake  12 .  \\n      The thermoelectric conversion device  26  is advantageously a solid state device and may, for example, take the form of a thermotunnel converter such as a thermotunnel diode or, moreover, an array of such diodes. Such diodes are characterised by having two opposing electrodes separated by a nanometre scale gap across which electrons can tunnel when a sufficient temperature differential is created between the electrodes. Such a temperature differential is provided in the above embodiment by placing one electrode of the diodes  26  in thermal communication with the brake cooling fluid, and the opposite electrode of the diodes in thermal communication with the second fluid circulating through the fluid cooling circuit  24 . The tunneling electrons transfer heat from the brake cooling fluid to the second fluid thereby effectively cooling the brake cooling fluid.  \\n      The brake cooling circuit  18  can comprise a valve  30  and bypass branch  32  where the valve  30  operates to cause the brake cooling fluid to flow through the branch  32  thereby bypassing the heat exchanger  22  when the temperature of the brake cooling fluid is lower than a selected temperature. Once the selected temperature is reached, the valve  30  switches to allow the brake cooling fluid to flow through the heat exchanger  22 , but not through the bypass branch  32 .  \\n      The fluid cooling circuit  24  may include a radiator  34  to dissipate heat transferred to the second fluid and/or a mechanically or electrically driven fan  36 .  \\n      FIGS.  2  to  4  illustrate one form of brake  12  that can be incorporated into the system  10 . In this embodiment, the brake  12  is in the form of a drum brake of a type described in Applicant&#39;s Australian Patent Application No. 2003904669, the contents of which are incorporated herein by way of reference. The brake system  12  includes a drum  38  having an inner circumferential surface  40  to which is attached three arcuate layers or pads of friction material which are evenly spaced about the surface  40  of the drum  38 . The surfaces of the pads constitute the friction surface  16 . The brake  12  also comprises a pair of brake shoes  42 , each having an outer convex surface constituting the brake surface  14  which face the friction surface  16 . The surfaces  14  are outer surfaces of arcuate manifolds  44  which, with reference to  FIG. 1 , constitute or equate with the portion  20  of the brake cooling circuit  18  through which the brake cooling fluid flows. Each manifold  44  has a plurality of parallel internal channels  46  which communicate with a fluid inlet  48  at one end and a fluid outlet  50  at the opposite end. Thus, the brake cooling fluid in circuit  18  flows through the inlet  48 , through the channels  46  and out the outlet  50  en route to the heat exchanger  22 . The manifold  44  is made from a metal and thus will have a substantially higher thermal conductivity than the friction pads forming the friction surface  16 . When the brake  12  is applied so that the braking surface  14  is in contact with the friction surface  16 , the subsequently generated heat will be preferentially conducted through the manifold  44  and to the brake cooling fluid flowing therethrough.  \\n      The brake shoes  42  are mounted so as to slide lineally toward and away from the friction material  16  by operation of a pair of spaced-apart hydraulic pistons  52  and a pair of tension springs  54  coupled therebetween. Further, the brake  12  may be manifested as a wet brake in which the drum  38  is disposed within a sealed housing (not shown) which also holds a supply of lubricating liquid for lubricating the braking surface  14  and friction surface  16 . In this event, scrapers  55  are provided at opposite ends of each manifold  44  for the purposes of wiping the lubricating fluid from the friction surface  16  during the braking operation. Alternatively, the scrapers can be provided in the space between adjacent layers or pads of friction material to scrape lubricating fluid from the braking surface  14 . Further details of the operation of the brake  12  depicted in FIGS.  1  to  4  are provided in the aforementioned incorporated reference, Australian Application No. 2003904669.  \\n      FIGS.  6  to  8  depict an embodiment of the brake  12  in the form of a wet disc brake system of the type described in Applicant&#39;s Australian Patent Application No. 2003902857, the contents of which are incorporated herein by way of reference. The brake system  12  comprises an annular rotor  56  having opposite radial faces on which friction pads  58  are mounted. The surface of the friction pads  58  constitute the friction surface  16 . The rotor  56  is bolted to a wheel hub  60  (only a portion of which is depicted for clarity). On each side of the rotor  56  there is provided an annular manifold  62  through which brake cooling fluid flows. The manifold  62  is equivalent to the portion  20  of the circuit  18  shown in  FIG. 1 . The surfaces of each of the manifolds  62  facing the friction material  16  constitute the braking surface  14 . Hydraulic pistons  64  are provided for selectively moving the manifolds  62  linearly into contact with the rotor  56  so that the braking surfaces  14  engage the friction surfaces  16  to produce a braking effect. The heat generated during this process is conducted by the brake cooling fluid as it flows through the manifolds  62  and the remainder of the brake cooling circuit  18 .  \\n      A sealed housing  66  encases the braking surface  14  and friction surface  16 , supports the pistons  64 , and contains a volume of lubricating liquid (not shown) for lubricating the braking and friction surfaces  14  and  16 . A rotary seal (not shown) on one side of the housing  66  enables the hub  60  to extend therethrough, while a rotary seal (not shown) on an opposite side of the housing  66  enables connection of the hub  60  with a vehicle wheel (not shown).  \\n      With particular reference to  FIGS. 7 and 8 , it can be seen that the manifold  62  is formed with a plurality of internal arcuate channels  68  spaced apart by parallel ribs  70 . The channels  68  communicate at one end with a fluid inlet  72  and at an opposite end with a fluid outlet  74 . Thus, the brake cooling fluid in circuit  18  flows through the inlet  72 , through the channels  68  and out the outlet  74  en route to the heat exchanger  22 . As in the previously described embodiment, the manifold  62  is made from a metal and therefore has substantially higher thermal conductivity than the friction pads  58  so that the heat generated by braking will be preferentially transferred into the manifold  62  and subsequently to the brake cooling fluid flowing through the circuit  18 .  \\n      Further mechanical and operational details of the brake  12  are described in the aforementioned incorporated reference, Australian Application No. 2003902857.  \\n      The braking system  12  may be incorporated into either a conventional vehicle having a fossil fuel engine or alternatively a hybrid vehicle having a fossil fuel engine and an electric engine, where the brake  12  is associated with one or more wheels of the vehicle so that when the brake  12  is operated, heat generated by the brake of the vehicle is used to generate an electric current which can be subsequently used to provide power assistance to the vehicle or indeed any other purpose. Moreover, when the system  10  is used in conjunction with a hybrid vehicle, the electric energy stored in the capacitor  28  can be discharged selectively via an electrical circuit (not shown) to provide additional power to the electric engine, for example, at times of acceleration or heavy load.  \\n      Further, the vehicle, be it a conventional vehicle or a hybrid vehicle, will include usually an engine cooling circuit, typically in the form of a radiator, water jacket and water pump, circulating a coolant such as glycol through the jacket. The embodiments of the present system  10  can be modified so that the engine cooling fluid can also be channeled through the heat exchanger  22  to provide an additional source of heat for generating further electric current. The brake cooling fluid and engine cooling fluid will remain separate, though heat from both transferred via the heat exchanger  22  and through the solid state thermoelectric conversion device  26  to the cooling circuit  24 . In order to manage the heat transfer, the heat exchanger  22  can be scaled up as required or alternatively a plurality of heat exchangers  22  may be provided in thermal communication with the brake cooling circuit  18  and/or the engine cooling circuit, and either a common scaled-up cooling circuit  24  or individual cooling circuits  24 . The current generated by each of the heat exchangers  22  can be either stored in separate storage devices  28  or fed to a common larger storage device.  \\n      In addition, if desired, a heat trap or heat store can be provided which contains a large volume of liquid that is heated by thermal conduction from the brake cooling fluid and engine cooling fluid, the heat store then used to transfer heat to the heat exchanger  22 .  \\n      All modifications and variations in the embodiments described in the above invention that will be obvious to a person skilled in the art are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention, the nature of which is to be determined from the above description and the appended claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005204002-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A system is described for a Dynamic Online Email Catalog useful in providing a means to collect, categorize, arrange, store and display direct email marketing messages for the benefit of users by way of secure web access to assigned private user areas.

The result is that solicited messages likely to be more valued by the consumer are often deleted along with the unsolicited email. The same email messages also fail to realize maximum impact due to the fact that a consumer&#39;s regular email box does not provide the means by which the email messages can be effectively stored and displayed for future reference when a consumer might be in the mood and have the time to shop.  \\n      Another problem involves the scenario wherein there would be multiple independent parties (e.g. ISPs, credit card issuers, etc.) that would be creating, assigning and issuing pseudo email addresses to users (e.g. consumers) for distribution to second parties (e.g. merchants) as a way of protecting a user&#39;s privacy by shielding their regular email address from being abused by unsolicited marketers. This scenario would also have it that there would be one or more outside third parties (e.g. infomediaries), not necessarily the same as those independent parties issuing the email addresses, who wished to provide value-added service to users by aggregating, storing and manipulating incoming emails in a variety of means.  \\n      In the above mentioned scenario the outside third parties would be limited in their ability to provide a service for instance where the date and time of email creation and distribution would prove valuable. The information of date and time would be known only by those independent parties creating, assigning and issuing the email addresses.  \\n      The knowledge of date and time of email creation, assignment and issuance together with the identity of the specific second parties to which the emails were conveyed would be useful for example in establishing the date and time at which a user conveyed an email address to a specific second party as a matter of establishing one-to-one communication relationship. Knowing the date and/or time at which such relationship was formed and then comparing this information to the current date and/or time would provide a means of determining length of relationship between an individual user and a specific second party. Experts in the field of marketing are growing to recognize such determination of permitted one-to-one relationship as possibly the one most critical single measure of how much an individual values or trusts a particular relationship.  \\n      Thus it would be desirable to provide the means by which email marketing messages resulting from opt in decisions by consumers could be accumulated, stored and managed in a way that such messages could be accessed and used by consumers for an extended period of time.  \\n      It would further be desirable to provide the means by which pseudo email addresses created, assigned and issued by multiple independent parties for the purpose of providing users the means of secure one-to-one relationship with trusted second parties could incorporate information revealing the date and/or time at which the pseudo email address was created or exchanged as part of an electronic commerce transaction. Such means would prove useful in the scenario in which there would also be one or more outside third parties interested in the date and/or time of pseudo email creation, assignment or issuance as a matter of providing users a value-added service not necessarily provided by the same independent parties.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      In one aspect, the present invention provides a Dynamic Online Email Catalog that enhances the overall value of relationship email marketing by using means to collect, categorize, arrange, store and display direct email marketing messages prior to their reception at a consumer&#39;s regular electronic mailbox. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention a plurality of email marketing messages are collected, categorized, arranged, stored and displayed.  \\n      A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes the incorporation of a date and/or time stamp in conjunction with the creation, issuance or use of a pseudo email address (defined as not the user&#39;s only or primary email address) assigned to a consumer in conjunction with an electronic commerce transaction. The date and/or time stamp also can reflect the date and/or time of transaction, or the date and/or time of the creation, assignment or issuance of a \\u201climited use\\u201d credit or debit card number for use in an electronic commerce transaction.  \\n      Another aspect involves ranking of received email messages according to different functions of time (e.g. average) with respect to the length of time (i.e. life span) that individual user email addresses or different aggregate groups of user email addresses have been established with a particular second party (e.g. merchant) or a group of second parties (e.g. merchant affiliate network).  \\n      Another aspect involves the creation and management of new \\u201cfrom\\u201d email addresses in response to targeted emails received by a third party (e.g. Dynamic Online Email Catalog) from a second party affiliate(s) in which the new from address is attached to the received email message so as to forward the message by having it piggyback on the domain address of the sponsoring second party.  \\n      Another aspect involves the incorporation of an electronic language translator useful in providing multilingual translation into one or more target language texts in which a user is then provided with an option of viewing one or more of the target language tests with or without the source language texts.  \\n      Another aspect involves the incorporation of a system and method for searching a database of records (e.g. Internet records) in response to user requests for the purpose of locating and retrieving information in which search results are able to be displayed in rank order based upon different functions of time (e.g. average) with respect to the length of time (i.e. life span) that individual user email addresses or different aggregate groups of user email addresses have been established with a particular second party (e.g. merchant) or a group of second parties (e.g. merchant affiliate network) identified with the individual ranked search results.  \\n      This invention is not limited to email messages. Those skilled in the art may use similar systems and methods for managing electronic transactions involving other types of media relationships between users and second parties (e.g. telemarketing, or TV infomercial).

A key aspect of the invention is the creation of web site  100  to serve as an intermediary tool for accessing, viewing and responding to stored and managed email messages. The technology required for creating and operating the web site is readily available and in use today as a means for providing users web-based email (e.g. Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)) as a supplemental service to regular email (e.g. Post Office Protocol (POP)) accessed from their home PC.  \\n      Each user of the Dynamic Online Email Catalog preferably has an assigned private user area (i.e. personal catalog) within web site  100  that only they are able to access. Users are granted access to the private user area by going to the web site and entering their regular e-mail address or another static identifier that they submitted when they first signed up for the service. As an added security measure, one embodiment enables users to use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) together with their static identifier. Other available means of secure access include users clicking on a prompt available on their PC home page, e-wallet, digital phone screen, etc.  \\n      Preferably, within each private user area is found a plurality of mailboxes  101 ,  102 ,  103 ,  104 . The mailboxes are arranged so as to populate the screen much like different product categories and listings in conventional online catalogs.  FIG. 1  shows one embodiment including four mailboxes of equal size and proportion. Another embodiment provides for increasing numbers of mailboxes to be added to the display. Another embodiment provides for multiple web pages to accommodate added mailboxes. Another embodiment calls for the mailboxes to be arranged in various ways and among other graphics and hyperlinks so as to increase the style and flexibility of the information choices provided through the display. Each mailbox is preferably labeled with specific product and service categories (e.g. men&#39;s casual wear, insurance services, etc.) or alternatively the names of specific product/service providers (e.g. merchants) depending on the intended use of the mailbox.  \\n      The infrastructure supporting web site  100  (servers, database, mail boxes, etc.) receives the email messages sent using pseudo e-mail addresses that users are assigned in the course of executing electronic commerce transactions. This is preferably accomplished by distinguishing the domain address of the Dynamic Online Email Catalog similar to those commonly used for ISPs or other businesses.  \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates an embodiment of a pseudo email address with date and/or time stamp. A preferred pseudo email address includes an identifier portion in addition to the date and/or time stamp portion. The identifier portion preferably contains one or more fields and consists of alphanumeric characters or alternatively characters from an extended character set. It is used to send email to the designated recipient. The date and/or time stamp portion reflects the date and/or time of generation, issuance, or use as part of an electronic commerce transaction. Shown also is a preferred embodiment in which the pseudo email address includes a standard format for a web domain email address. The illustration of the email address is just one example of the number of fields and choice of fields that may be used.  \\n       FIG. 3  illustrates an embodiment of the system for the generation and issuance of a pseudo email address. Third Party Host Computer(s)  300  is connected to Internet  303  via Server(s)  301  and Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302 . User Computerized Device  304  is connected to Internet  303  via Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302 . Second Party and/or Agent Host Computer(s)  306  is connected to Internet  303  via Server(s)  305  and Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302 .  \\n      Contained within Third Party Host Computer(s)  300  is a system including microprocessor(s), random access memory, hard disk(s), a clock, and a custom software application capable of generating and assigning date and/or time stamped random and/or variable identifiers to users in response to requests.  \\n       FIG. 4  illustrates an embodiment of a method used in conjunction with the system illustrated in  FIG. 3  to generate, issue and store pseudo email addresses in combination with user personally identifiable information (e.g. name, primary email address, credit card primary account number, etc.) and/or non-personally identifiable information (e.g. demographic profile, financial net worth, etc.).  \\n      To use the system, a user requests a pseudo email address from a third party. The third party can be enlisted as an agent of the second party or an agent of the user. In the event the third party is enlisted as an agent of the user, the personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information of the user would be previously stored by or made available to the third party in advance of the request for a pseudo email address unless the user was not known to the agent in which case there would be involved the step of registration.  \\n      In the event the third party is an agent of the second party, the personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information of the user would be requested and selectively submitted by the user or made available by permission of the user as part of the process of establishing a pseudo email address.  \\n      In receiving the request for a pseudo email address, a process of authentication is preferably initiated by a system operating in conjunction with the Third Party Host(s) Computers  300 . Upon successful authentication of the user, the system generates the pseudo email address, stores the address with the user personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information, transfers the address to Server(s)  301  and from there via Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303  to the user&#39;s web browser operating in conjunction with User Computerized Device  304 .  \\n      In the event the third party is an agent of the second party, there is an alternative embodiment in which the newly generated pseudo email address remains with the third party and is not transferred to the user web browser.  \\n      By whatever means it is accomplished, once issued the pseudo email address would function just like a regular email address. The same process preferably allows the user to retain the ability to discontinue or suspend the active status of the posted pseudo email address similar to the methods currently employed for both pseudo email addresses and limited use credit or debit card numbers. The user preferably is able to perform the steps necessary for discontinuing or suspending the active status of a posted email address by clicking a selection(s) available in their private user area. This function would require custom-written software.  \\n      In the event that the third party providing the pseudo email address to the user is not the same third party providing the service of the Dynamic Online Email Catalog, an established contractual arrangement between the parties would lay the groundwork for a process in which a second pseudo email address would be created for use as a forwarding address in an effort to federate the previously established relationship between the user and the first third party and the provider of the Dynamic Online Email Catalog. The steps involved with providing the second pseudo email to the Dynamic Online Email Catalog would also involve establishing a communication link through which the non-personally identifiable information of the user would also be made available.  \\n       FIG. 5  illustrates an embodiment of the system involved with the process in which email messages are forwarded to List Server(s)  500  and Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501  from Second Party Host Computer(s)  306  using Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303 .  \\n      Contained within List Server(s)  500  and Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501  is a system including microprocessor(s), random access memory, hard disk(s), a clock, and preferably a custom software application incorporating sophisticated filtering software. The use of filtering software as part of a preferred embodiment enables incoming email messages to be parsed as part of a process in which certain words are identified and matched against updated word sets associated with specific mailboxes so as to accurately direct email messages to the appropriate mailbox assigned to a specific product/service category or alternatively to a specific second party. The process also preferably involves steps in which a correlating mailbox identifier is inserted into the email address so as to correctly address incoming email messages for final delivery. An alternative embodiment includes substitution of code numbers in place of actual descriptors. Technology capable of meeting the requirements of these embodiments is readily available.  \\n       FIG. 6  illustrates an embodiment of a pseudo email address with Product/Service Sub Domain Address  600 . In this example, the category \\u201cwomen&#39;s shoes\\u201d is inserted into the email address as a sub domain address. This allows incoming email messages to be targeted to specific product/service categories contained within the Dynamic Online Email Catalog. The illustration of the email address is just one example of the number of fields and choice of fields that may be used.  \\n      Organization of email messages in the Dynamic Online Email Catalog is further enhanced by preferably having newly incoming email messages to specific mailboxes take priority position within specific retail categories over previously sent emails from the same originating address. This preferably involves having incoming emails trigger the sub-listing or deletion of previously received email messages so as to avoid a situation in which a deluge of emails from a specific second party would bury competing emails messages from other second parties.  \\n      The exception would be the scenario in which specific mailboxes appearing in a private user area are assigned exclusively to specific product/service providers. Here, second parties or their agents are preferably able to select the amount of email storage capacity they wish to maintain in conjunction with various user accounts with the total charges for storage being determined based upon the amount of storage leased. Second parties or their agents are also preferably able to tailor storage capacity to fit particular user profiles (e.g. customers who access the Dynamic Online Email Catalog at a certain frequency, customers known to have made past purchases, or customers exceeding a certain spending amount, etc.).  \\n       FIG. 7  illustrates a preferred embodiment of the system in which List Server(s)  500  shares the same local area network as Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501 .  \\n      One embodiment provides for both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information gathered from participating users being recorded to a database in conjunction with the various pseudo email addresses assigned to a user in relation to specific second parties. The stored information is also preferably indexed according to different product/service categories and demographic profile classifications. The database is preferably queried by List Server(s)  500  using custom written applications providing the means of continually updating mailing lists to account for those pseudo email addresses that have been deactivated by users.  \\n      One embodiment provides for a process involving use of mailing lists for delivering email messages as a value added service to second parties, especially those lacking the technology or ability to pursue a sophisticated targeted email campaign. The process preferably involves steps in which a second party and/or agent uses Second Party or Agent Computerized Device  700  and Second Party or Agent Host Computer(s)  306  to request and receive secure access to List Server(s)  500  via Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303  for the purpose of uploading email templates for ultimate distribution to Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501 , the second party and/or agent selects from specific product/service categories and specific demographic classifications and/or inputs other data thus allowing their preferences for intended delivery of a particular email message to be transmitted to List Server Host Computer(s)  500 , using an identifier specific to the second party or agent a custom written application operating in conjunction with List Server Host Computer(s)  500  queries the database in which the personal and non-personally identifying information of users is stored, the identifier limits the query to accessing only those accounts identified by active pseudo email addresses relative to the second party or agent, the identified active pseudo email addresses are extracted and applied to the email message, using a custom written software application additional information is added to the pseudo email address so as to correctly address incoming email messages for final delivery, the email message is placed in queue for delivery, the email message is forwarded to each designated mailbox.  \\n      A user is able to access information stored in conjunction with Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501  preferably via web access using a web browser operating on Computerized Device  304 . Upon successful authentication, an application operating in conjunction with Host Computer(s)  501  is invoked whereby a query is made to the database and information relevant to the user account, including stored email messages, is retrieved and transmitted via Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303  to the user web browser. Using a keyboard or mouse the user is then able to select specific emails listed within mailboxes  101 ,  102 ,  103 ,  104 . Clicking on an individual email causes the message to expand so that it can be read and any rich email content viewed. Users are also able to scroll emails up and down so the complete content can be digested. In addition, users are preferably able to click on hyperlinks contained within an email message which causes a request to be redirected by way of Host Computer(s)  501  and transmitted via Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303  to a second party web site where the user is then able continue browsing while still logged into Host Computer(s)  501 . When finished browsing emails and other linked content, a user is able to log out of the Dynamic Online Email Catalog whereby the application serving the private user area is closed. It is also preferable that sophisticated security measures be incorporated to protect against abuse of the system.  \\n      One embodiment involves the use of the date and/or time stamp of the pseudo email addresses used in conjunction with incoming marketing messages to help in enabling a process in which incoming email messages within certain product and service categories are displayed in rank order based on the average length of \\u201ccustomer relationship\\u201d maintained by individual merchants across all of their participating users or as an alternative embodiment those participating users of a certain profile classification. This is preferably accomplished by a process in which a comparison is conducted of all active and deactivated or suspended date and/or time stamped email addresses established with individual second parties. The process operates in conjunction with Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501 . The ranking of received email messages would be prioritized according to a trust score reflecting different functions of time (e.g. average) with respect to the total relative lengths of time (i.e. life spans) that individual user email addresses or different aggregate groups of user email addresses have been established with a specific second party or a group of second parties (e.g. merchant affiliate network) wherein those scores reflecting longer life spans are given higher priority placement and as a result higher visibility within mailboxes  101 ,  102 ,  103 ,  104  displayed on web page  100 . Supporting this is preferably a process similar to the means in which conventional HTML email is managed wherein it is common that some or all of the content (e.g. graphics and/or heading) of the first received of unread emails is made visible to the user.  \\n      An simplified example of a trust score calculation is able to be illustrated by considering two different merchants each of them with three customers having active pseudo email address accounts and three customer names associated with deactivated pseudo email addresses. In order to determine a trust score, one embodiment involving a custom written application operating in conjunction with Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501  looks at the date and/or time stamps of the three active addresses for each merchant, looks at the current date and time, calculates a snapshot of the combined total length of time for the three active addresses for each merchant, looks at the date and/or time stamps of the three deactivated addresses for each merchant, looks at the date and time the addresses were deactivated, calculates the combined total length of time for the three deactivated addresses for each merchant, adds together the combined total lengths of time for both the three active and three deactivated addresses for each merchant, divides by six the total resulting from the addition of the combined lengths of time for both the three active and three deactivated addresses for each merchant. The same embodiment then compares the two time averages and determines the highest time average (i.e. trust score).  \\n      When a user accesses a private user area, the act of doing so preferably invokes a process whereby the trust scores of the second parties are calculated in real time and compared. This information is taken into account with the result being that the email messages originating from second parties with higher trust scores are given priority placement in each of the mailboxes displayed by the Dynamic Online Email Catalog. An alternative embodiment less demanding on the operational demands of the system provides for the trust score to be calculated once every 24 hours for all product and service providers.  \\n      Use of the trust score ranking system would be preferable in the situation where second parties are limited to one email per each product/service category mailbox in a user private area.  \\n       FIG. 8  illustrates an embodiment of a system used in conjunction with a means of searching for, locating and retrieving information within specific private user areas of the Dynamic Online Email Catalog in response to requests initiated by users assigned to those areas. The search apparatus operates in conjunction with Search Engine Host Computer(s)  800  which a user is able to access from User Computerized Device  103  via Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303 . An embodiment of a method used in conjunction with the system involves those steps in which a user preferably inputs a product/service category or alternatively a specific second party name, the user triggers the search engine by clicking an icon appearing as part of the GUI provided in conjunction with a private user area, the custom written application supporting the search engine function queries the database using the inputted product/service category or specific second party name, the location of the inputted product/service category or specific second party name triggers a process by which a display is retrieved and displayed.  \\n       FIG. 9  illustrates an embodiment of an affiliate new \\u201cfrom\\u201d email address with date and/or time stamp. Preferably the from email address includes an identifier portion containing the real business name of the affiliate in addition to the date and/or time stamp portion. An alternative embodiment provides the identifier portion to contain the real domain name most readily identified with the affiliate. The identifier portion preferably contains one or more fields comprised of alphanumeric characters or alternatively characters from an extended character set. The date and/or time stamp portion preferably reflects the date and/or time of generation, issuance, or use of a new from email address in response to the receiving of a target email message from a second party affiliate. Shown also is a preferred embodiment in which the from email address includes a standard format for a web domain email address including preferably the real business of the second party or alternatively the real domain name most readily identified with the affiliate. The illustration of the from email address is just one example of the number of fields and choice of fields that may be used.  \\n       FIG. 10  illustrates an embodiment of those components of a system involved with providing a means for a second party affiliate(s) to send target emails to private user areas of a Dynamic Online Email Catalog by piggybacking email messages on the domain address of the sponsoring second party. Second Party Affiliate(s) Host Computer(s)  1001  connects via Server(s)  1000  to Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303  through which a communication link is able to be formed with List Server(s)  500  and ultimately Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501 . A target email template originating with the second party affiliate(s) is preferably sent not directly to a private user area(s) of the Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501 , but rather to an established account of the sponsoring second party using an email address such as \\u201csecondparty@emailcatalog.com.\\u201d \\n       FIG. 11  illustrates an embodiment of a method describing generally the steps involved with the generation and issuance of new \\u201cfrom\\u201d email addresses in response to target email messages received from second party affiliates. In the example shown, the steps preferably include the receipt of an email template triggering a process in which the from address is extracted and used as part of a query made to an established account of a second party to check to see if an active from address incorporating both the affiliate and the second party identifiers is present, if an active from address is located then the from address is substituted in place of the originating from address and the email is processed using similar means to target emails received from second parties using established pseudo email addresses, if an active from address is not located then second party account is checked to see if the from address is active status, if the from address is not located or located and determined to be not of \\u201cactive\\u201d status then the email is rejected, if the from address is located and determined to be active a process is triggered in which the from address is combined with the domain address of the second party to which the email was sent to form a new \\u201cfrom\\u201d email address and in forming a new from address, the new from address is substituted in place of the originating from address and the email is processed using similar means to target emails received from second parties using established pseudo email addresses.  \\n      A preferred embodiment provides that the date and/or time appearing in conjunction with an affiliate from email address be referenced similar to the date and/or time appearing in conjunction with established pseudo email addresses as part of the process involving the ranking of email messages.  \\n      When it comes to a user sending an email in response to a target email received from an affiliate, preferably the process is similar to re-mailing whereby the new from email address is stripped and replaced by the original from address so as to facilitate proper routing of the email message.  \\n      Note that a preferred embodiment provides that future emails sent by the affiliate are still required to be sent in care of the sponsoring second party as a custom written software application operating in conjunction with Dynamic Online Email Catalog  501  and List Server(s)  500  is employed to restrict any direct communications involving use of an established pseudo email address to the domain address of the second party.  \\n       FIG. 12  illustrates an embodiment of the incorporation of an electronic language translator as an added innovation to the present invention.

A system and method for providing an electronic language translator capable of meeting the requirements of the current invention is described in U.S. Patent Document 20010029455 \\u201cMethod and apparatus for providing multilingual translation over a network\\u201d and is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  \\n      In U.S. Patent Document 20010029455 there is described a means in which a source language text (e.g. English) is received as an input to the electronic language translator, the source language test is translated at the electronic language translator at the time of submission into one or more target language texts (e.g. Japanese), and a user is then provided with an option of viewing one or more of the target language texts with or without the source language text. U.S. Patent Document 20010029455 further describes a data provider as being any device that supplies either static or dynamic data to a client device over the data transmission infrastructure wherein the invention of an electronic language translator is capable of acting as an intermediary in data exchange, translating the data from one language to another as it passes from client device to data provider, from data provider to client device, or from client device to client device.  \\n      The present invention provides the incorporation of such a means for an electronic language translator wherein a Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer(s)  501 , Search Engine Host Computer(s)  800 , and Second Party or Agent Host Computer(s)  306  are examples of devices supplying either static or dynamic data to User Computerized Device  304  and List Server(s) is an example of a device supplying similar data to Second Party or Agent Host Computer(s)  306  and Second Party or Agent Computerized Device  700  is a second client device to complement User Computerized Device  304 .  \\n      Note that those skilled in the art may use similar systems and methods in meeting the requirements of an electronic language translator.  \\n       FIG. 13  is a block diagram illustrating the functional elements of a search apparatus incorporating that aspect of the invention involved with searching a database of records (e.g. Internet records, email records across different aggregate user groups) in response to user requests for the purpose of locating and retrieving information in which the search results are able to be displayed in rank order based on different functions of time (e.g. average) with respect to the length of time (i.e. life span) that individual user email addresses or different aggregate groups of user email addresses have been established with a particular second party (e.g. merchant) or a group of second parties (e.g. merchant affiliate network) identified with the individual ranked search results. A system and method for providing a search apparatus and method capable of meeting the requirements of the current invention with certain modifications is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,090 \\u201cMethod and apparatus for searching a database of records\\u201d and is hereby incorporated herein in its; entirety by reference.  \\n      The search apparatus operates in conjunction with Search Engine Host Computer(s)  800  which a user is able to access from User Computerized Device  103  via Wired and/or Wireless Telecommunications Network  302  and Internet  303 . According to a preferred embodiment, the apparatus  1300  includes a search processor  1301  and a grouping processor  1302 . The grouping processor comprises a record processor  1303 , a candidate generator  1304 , a weighing processor  1305 , and a display processor  1306 . These elements are software modules and have been so identified merely to illustrate the functionality of the invention. The apparatus  1300  communicates with a User Computerized Device  304  (Note that alternatively a conventional telephone can be substituted in conjunction with a sophisticated voice activation system) and a database(s)  1308 , which preferably includes Internet and push driven content records (e.g. target email messages), via an I/O bus  1309 . The apparatus  1300  is capable of communicating with a plurality of remotely located users over a wide area network (e.g. the Internet).  \\n       FIG. 14  is a flow chart illustrating the sequence of steps used by the search apparatus in performing a search. With reference to  FIGS. 13 and 14 , the search processor  1301  receives search instructions (i.e., a query) from a User Computerized Device  304  via the bus  1309  (step  1400 ). The search processor  1301  searches the database(s)  1308  and generates a search result list corresponding to a selected set of the records (step  1401 ). The selected set of records are ranked according to relevancy criteria.  \\n      In one embodiment, an example of the relevancy criteria for ranking the records preferably includes the following rules: \\n          1. If there are more \\u201chits\\u201d (a word in a record matching a word in the search criteria), the record ranks higher;     2. If the query term phrase is a hit versus the words separately being hits, the record ranks higher;     3. If the capitalization is the same as in the query term, the record ranks higher;     4. If the query term is in the title, the record ranks higher;     5. If the query term is in the abstract, the record ranks higher; and     6. If the query term is in the keywords, the record ranks higher.        \\n\\n      7. If a current calculated trust score is available for a second party identified in conjunction with the record, the record ranks higher.  \\n      8. If a current calculated trust score for a second party identified in conjunction with the record is greater than other available trust scores for other second parties identified in conjunction with competing records, the record ranks higher.  \\n      An additional embodiment provides for the incorporation of relevancy criteria reflecting trust scoring to be further limited to those stored active pseudo email addresses belonging to users defined by certain non-personally identifiable information (e.g. sex, age, income, net worth, average net worth growth rate, etc.) These personal profile characteristics are able to be selected and inputted in conjunction with the search term either by the user in initiating a search or alternatively as a matter of process involving further enhancements of the invention in which non-personally identifiable information of the user (e.g. current net worth) is able to be automatically referenced and incorporated on behalf of the user.  \\n     Alternative Embodiments  \\n      An alternative embodiment provides for the use of various systems and software applications to accommodate alternative media messages.  \\n      An example of such a message is an audible recorded messages for use in telemarketing. Here, a user phone number or some form of proxy identifier would be used to forward the audible recorded messages to the user. The system would involve the use of designated secure voicemail box similar to the function of a Dynamic Online Email Catalog.  \\n      Second parties would be able to forward telemarketing messages to the voicemail box using an automatic dialer similar to the use of a list server in forwarding targeted email messages. Incoming messages would be stored within different product/service categories that users would be able to select by either touching their keypad or simply speaking and having their instructions interpreted by a sophisticated voice activation software application. Users are able to access the voicemail box by dialing a special telephone number or possibly exercising an option offered through their primary voicemail service. Security could also be enhanced by requiring the input of a PIN or through use of voice authentication.  \\n      The incoming telemarketing messages also can include a date and/or time stamp reflecting the time the user agreed to allow voicemail messages to be forwarded by a particular second party or association. The date and/or time stamp also can be derived from the date and/or time stamp applied to a user pseudo email address established with the same second party. Similar to the Dynamic Online Email Catalog, the voicemail catalog would rank voicemail messages within specific categories based upon a function of the length of relationship of individual users or different aggregate groups of users.  \\n      Another alternative involves TV infomercials. Those skilled in the art are able to envision a similar system and method in which infomercials would be forwarded to an electronic box capable of storing digital television signals. The targeted infomercial mailbox would be available through a designated channel that users would access by touching the keypad on their TV remote or other means. Having arrived at the channel users would be able to select from various categories using a special function on their remote. Similar to the Dynamic Online Email Catalog, the infomercial mailbox channel could highlight different categories or premium listings within a category through the use of rich graphic or video content. Again, the received infomercials also can be ranked based upon relative length of trust relationship among individual users or different aggregate groups of users. A date and/or time stamp also can be incorporated as part of a special identifier and reflect the date and/or time stamp applied to a user pseudo email address established with the same second party.  \\n      Another alternative provides a means in which emails, voicemails and infomercials would not be pre-transmitted to a central storage media (box) but remain with the host of second party or agent until requested as a result of a signal being received from a user. In such instance, information is transmitted to the box and the user can make a request to receive the full message based on the information.  \\n      Another alternative provides a means in which target email messages originating with second party affiliates are sent first to the sponsoring second party for the purpose of being forwarded to users by a method in which the affiliate email message is able to piggyback by way of a communication link involving the second party. One embodiment involves a system and method similar to the above described preferred embodiment providing for the from email address of the affiliate to be combined with that of the second party in order to create a new from email address. An alternative embodiment involves a system and method providing for the affiliate email message to be forwarded using active pseudo email address or addresses established with the second party in which the from address can reflect the identity of the affiliate or the identity of the second party although this is considered less desirable in that it deprives the user the ability to immediately identify the true originator of a received email message.  \\n      The hardware components needed for implementing this invention are currently in existence. However, it is expected that some custom written applications can be desired to assure smooth flow within the system. Such software can be readily written be a ordinarily skilled programmer.  \\n      Although the invention has been described in detail, it is to be understood that variations therein and modifications thereto may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth. For example, the functions of the various components used within the system can be provided by various microprocessors, servers and memory storage devices working together in a system. Also, if the Third Party Host Computer also operates the Dynamic Online Email Catalog Host Computer, the time stamp can be internally associated with the user email address in place of a component of the email address.

More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for producing a chitosan-containing salt, which comprises dissolving an acid-soluble chitosan in organic acid or dissolving a water-soluble chitosan derivative in water, to prepare a chitosan solution, spraying the chitosan solution on salt particles to bind the chitosan or its derivative to the salt particles, and drying and finely grinding the chitosan-bound salt particles.  \\n     BACKGROUND ART  \\n      Patients with cardiac vascular diseases, such as hypertension, or adult diseases, hard to cure, such as diabetes and renal failure, are recommended to limit salt or to take a small amount of salt. As salt which may be given to a patient with hypertension, there is now only salt whose sodium chloride (NaCl) content is reduced by adding potassium chloride (KCl). Even a functional salts, there are only garlic salt and green tea salt whose clinical results have not yet been found.  \\n      Hypertension is mainly described by a physiochemical mechanism caused by renin-angiotensin, and substances capable of inhibiting the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are currently of high concern for direct inhibition of hypertension. In addition to producing dipeptide, ACE is presumed to show an enzyme reaction mechanism similar to pancreatic carboxypeptidase A. On the basis of this presumption, chemically synthesized ACE inhibitor, such as captopril and enarapril, are used as antihypertensive agents. However, since such chemical products have many problems, such as safety, side effects, and the like, the searching of peptide-based ACE inhibitory substance from various natural substances is being continued.  \\n      Steady intake of food containing the ACE inhibitory substance will help the prevention or alleviation of hypertension. Chitosan is one of the biopolymer substances, prepared by deacetylating chitin which a kind of animal polysaccharides, present in the shell of shellfish, such as crabs or lobsters, and is known as the ACE inhibitory substance. Chitosan is a polysaccharide linked by \\u03b2-1,4-bond of D-glucosamine, and includes \\u03b1-chitosan derived from shellfishes, \\u03b2-chitosan from molluscs, and \\u03b3-chitosan from microbial strains.  \\n      Strictly speaking, chitosan can be defined as a chitin derivative, and acid-soluble chitosan is generally called \\u201cchitosan\\u201d. Examples of water-soluble chitosan include CM-chitosan (carboxymethyl-chitosan which carboxymethyl group is given by a chemical numerical formula), S-chitosan (oligosaccharide-chitosan), SCM-chitosan (N-sulfide derivative of N-deacetylated CM chitin), HP-chitosan (hydroxyl-propyl-chitosan), etc. Also, according to molecular weight, monosaccharide is called \\u201cglucosamine\\u201d, a complex of 2\\u02dc9 monosaccharides is called \\u201coligochitosan\\u201d, and a complex of more than 10 monosaccharides is called \\u201cchitosan\\u201d.  \\n      To make patients with hypertension or diabetes, avoid excessive intake of salt with low purity, such as a mixture of potassium chloride (50%) and sodium chloride (50%), has appeared, but its effect on hypertension has not been proved yet.  \\n      Meanwhile, Korean patent publication 95/5196A disclosed a liquid salt seasoning comprising a mixture of salt and chitosan. However, this patent application has no mention of a blood pressure lowering efficacy, and also has problems that it is not easy to mix seasoning liquid with 13% of chitosan, since it is difficult for chitosan generally being participated in alkaline water due to having an isoelectric point of pH 6.5, to be dissolved, and chitosan with a high-molecular weight is in a gel form even in acetic acid due to its high viscosity.  \\n      Furthermore, methods for producing chitosan salt are known, in which chitosan dissolved in organic acid is mixed with salt solution, and the mixture is subjected to stirring, evaporating, drying and crystallizing steps (Korean patent publication KR 01/00706A and KR 01/103538A). However, KR 01/103538A has no mention of the blood pressure lowering efficacy of the chitosan salt. KR 01/00706A suggests the blood pressure lowering efficacy of the chitosan salt, but has a problem that it requires the recrystallizing step so that production process is complex and a great increase in production costs is caused upon the mass production of the chitosan salt.  \\n     DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION  \\n      The present inventors have conducted many researches to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and consequently, found that when a solution of chitosan is sprayed on salt particles to bind the chitosan to the salt particles, chitosan-containing salt having a blood pressure lowering function can be economically produced without performing a recrystallization process. On the basis of this discovery, the present invention was perfected.  \\n      Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing chitosan-containing salt, which can produce the chitosan-containing salt by a simplified process at significantly decreased costs.  \\n      To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a method for producing a chitosan-containing salt having the function of lowering blood pressure, which comprises the steps of: (a) dissolving an acid-soluble chitosan in organic acid, or dissolving a water-soluble chitosan derivative in water, to prepare a chitosan solution; (b) spraying the chitosan solution on salt particles to bind the chitosan to the salt particles; and (c) drying the chitosan-bound salt particles.  \\n      The chitosan used in the step (a) of the inventive method is preferably \\u03b1-chitosan or \\u03b2-chitosan. Also, the chitosan or its derivative used in the step (a) has preferably a molecular weight of 10\\u02dc100 kDa. The content of the chitosan or its derivative in the chitosan-containing salt is preferably 1.5\\u02dc5%.  \\n      Moreover, the organic acid used in the step (a) preferably is lactic acid, acetic acid or ascorbic acid, and the salt used in the step (b) is preferably natural sea salt, refined salt or rock salt, which has the size of 10\\u02dc50 mesh.  \\n      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, natural sea salt produced in Korea is processed. Meanwhile, low-molecular weight chitosan is dissolved in an aqueous solution of organic acid (lactic acid, acetic acid or ascorbic acid), or a chitosan derivative is dissolved in water, to prepare a chitosan solution.  \\n      The chitosan solution is bound to the processed salt particles by a spraying or mixing process. The chitosan-bound salt particles are dried to produce a chitosan-containing salt. As the chitosan used in this embodiment, \\u03b1-, \\u03b2- or \\u03b3-chitosan may be used, but the \\u03b1-chitosan which is produced at large amounts and at a low cost is suitable.  \\n      The molecular weight of the chitosan is not specially limited. However, a chitosan having a molecular weight of 0.5\\u02dc500 kDa is preferred since it shows good binding force to the chlorine ion of salt. A chitosan having a molecular weight of 10\\u02dc100 kDa is more preferred since it is soft and has a good taste after intake without lowering the properties of salt. The chitosan content in the chitosan-containing salts is preferably 0.05\\u02dc5%, and more preferably 1.5\\u02dc5%. If the chitosan content is less than 1.5%, the blood pressure-lowering function of the chitosan-containing salt will be insufficient, and if the chitosan content is more than 5%, the taste of the chitosan-containing salt will be lessened due to an acrid taste of the chitosan. In addition, both the water-soluble chitosan and the acid-soluble chitosan may be used in the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is a graphic diagram showing the ACE inhibitory activity of a chitosan-containing salt.  \\n       FIG. 2  is a graphic diagram showing the ACE inhibitory activity of a chitosan-containing salt according to the molecular weight of chitosan.  \\n       FIG. 3  is a graphic diagram showing the result of measurement of blood pressure of rats according to the administration of a chitosan-containing salt.  \\n       FIG. 4  is a graphic diagram showing the correlation between salt and blood pressure according to the administration of chitosan-containing salt, when having had the rats exercise for two hours a day during breeding.  \\n       FIG. 5  is a graphic diagram showing the result of measurement of blood pressure according to the intake of chitosan-containing salt of hypertension-induced rats.  \\n       FIG. 6  shows the comparison between methods for producing chitosan-containing salt according to the present invention and the prior art. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The present invention will hereinafter be described in further detail by examples. It will however be obvious to a person skilled in the art that the examples are given only to illustrate the producing method and blood pressure lowering efficacy of chitosan-containing salt, and the scope of the present invention is not limited to or by the examples.  \\n     EXAMPLE 1  \\n     Production of Chitosan-Containing Salt  \\n      Low-molecular weight chitosan with a molecular weight of 50 kDa (deacetylation degree of 90%) was dissolved in an aqueous solution of 5% lactic acid, to prepare a solution of 10 wt % chitosan. 10 kg natural sea salt produced in Korea was processed into particles having a size of 15 mesh, and then 1, 2 and 3 liter of 10 wt % chitosan solution was sprayed on the salt particles respectively so that the chitosan was coated on, or bound to the salt particles. The chitosan-coated or -bound salt particles were dried to produce chitosan-containing salts having chitosan contents of 1%, 2% and 3%, respectively.  \\n      According to the same method as described above, 2% chitosan-containing salts were prepared using chitosan with molecular weights of 20, 40 and 100 kDa, respectively.  \\n     EXAMPLE 2  \\n     ACE Inhibitory Effect of Chitosan-Containing Salt  \\n      To examine the ACE inhibitory effect of the chitosan-containing salt produced in Example 1 above, 100 \\u03bcl of 2% chitosan-containing salt dissolved in distilled water was added to 250 \\u03bcl of a reaction solution. The mixed solution was left alone for 5 minutes at 37\\u00b0 C., to which 50 \\u03bcl of ACE was added and allowed to react for 30 minutes. Then, the reaction was terminated by adding 250 \\u03bcl of 1N HCl. The reaction product was mixed with 1.5 ml of ethyl acetate for 15 seconds and centrifuged. 1 ml of the supernatant was taken and dried in a speed bag with the removal of the ethyl acetate. Then, the remaining material was dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water and measured for the absorbance at 228 nm. From the measured absorbance, ACE inhibitory activity was calculated according to the following equation: \\n \\nACE inhibitory activity(%)=(1\\u2212 A/B )\\u00d7100; \\n \\n where A is the absorbance of a group added with the sample, and B is the absorbance of a group without addition of the sample. \\n \\n      The ACE inhibitory activities of commercial salt and chitosan-containing salt were examined (see  FIG. 1 ). As shown in  FIG. 1 , captopril (control group), a chemically synthesized inhibitor, showed 57%, which is the highest ACE inhibitory activity, the salt containing 3% chitosan showed an ACE inhibitory activity of 39.1%, and the commercial salt had little ACE inhibitory activity. It could be found that the commercial salt acted to increase the ACE activity whereas the chitosan-containing salt had a very excellent ACE inhibitory effect.  \\n      Also, the ACE inhibitory activity of the chitosan-containing salt was examined while maintaining the chitosan content at a level of 2% and changing the chitosan molecular weight from 20 kDa to 40 and 100 kDa (see  FIG. 2 ). As shown in  FIG. 2 , the chitosan-containing salt showed 27%, which is the highest ACE inhibitory activity at a molecular weight of 20 kDa, and the ACE inhibitory activity of the chitosan-containing salt was somewhat decreased with an increase of the molecular weight of the chitosan.  \\n     EXAMPLE 3  \\n     Measurement of Blood Pressure of Rats According to Administration of Chitosan-Containing Salt  \\n      16-week-old rats were divided into a control group fed with no salt feed, a group fed with 3% commercial salt feed, and a group fed with 3% chitosan salt feed, each group consisted of six rats. While the rats were bred for 5 weeks, the systolic pressure at the tail of the rats was measured once every week. One kg of feed to the experimental rats was composed of 544.9 g of corn, 20 g of soybean oil, 0.1 g of cholin chloride, 20 g of a vitamin mixture, 240 g of casein, 145 g of sugar and 30 g of salt. The blood pressure of the rats was measured with an RTBP 2000 single-channel system (World Precision Instruments), and the concentrations of sodium, chlorine and cholesterol in blood were measured with an UV spectrophotometer (Hitachi 7060).  \\n      In the results of measurement, the rats fed with 3% commercial salt feed showed about a 7 mmHg increase in blood pressure as compared to that before the experiment, whereas the rats fed with 3% chitosan salt feed showed about a 3 mmHg decrease in blood pressure (see  FIG. 3 ). This result of blood pressure reduction is presumed to be caused by the reduction of chlorine ion concentration in blood. This suggests that the chitosan acts to excrete an excess of the chlorine ions of salt out of the body.  \\n      Meanwhile, when the rats were allowed to move for two hours a day during breeding, the rats fed with 3% commercial salt feed showed about a 6 mmHg increase in blood pressure, whereas the rats fed with 3% chitosan salt feed showed about a 4 mmHg decrease in blood pressure (see  FIG. 4 ).  \\n      Furthermore, blood was collected from the rats at one month after the start of breeding, and analyzed for its Na and Cl ion concentrations. In the analysis results, chlorine concentration, cholesterol and neutral lipid in the control group fed with no salt feed have became lowered as compared to those before the experiment, but sodium and chlorine concentrations in the rats fed with 3% commercial salt feed has became increased as compared to those before the experiment. Meanwhile, it could be found that chlorine concentration and cholesterol in the rats fed with 3% chitosan salt feed has became lower than those in the rats fed with 3% commercial salt feed (see Table 1).  \\n               TABLE 1                          Changes of Na and Cl ion concentrations, cholesterol and neutral lipid according       to intake of chitosan-containing salt (TC: cholesterol; and TG: neutral lipid)                             Before the   One month after the start of breeding                                     experiment   Control   3% chitosan-   3% commercial       Contents   Control   (salt 0%)   containing salt feed   salt feed                                         Na(mM)   141.8   141.8   148.6   149.9       Cl(mM)   99.5   96.2   97.7   102.8       TC   112.3   92.6   105.5   113.8       TG   27.15   24.1   32.3   28.5                  \\n \\n     EXAMPLE 4  \\n     Blood Pressure Lowering Effect of Chitosan-Containing Salt in Hypertension-Induced Rats  \\n      The same experiment as in Example 3 was performed on hypertension-induced rats (see  FIG. 5 ). As shown in  FIG. 5 , the experiment results showed that blood pressure in the control group was continuously decreased, whereas blood pressure in the rats treated with commercial salt was slowly increased and after one month, an average of 5 mmHg increased to reach a risk level. However, blood pressure in the rat group fed with the chitosan salt was lowered incredibly.  \\n      Moreover, the measurement of Cl ion concentration in blood was performed. The results showed that the Cl ion concentration was 102.8 mM in the animal group administered with 3% commercial salt feed, but 97.7 mM in the group administered with 3% chitosan salt feed, which indicates a reduction of 5.1 mM in Cl ion concentration as compared to the commercial salt group. Such results suggest that the Cl ion is a main factor causing an increase in blood pressure.  \\n     EXAMPLE 5  \\n     Economic Efficiency of Inventive Method for Producing Chitosan-Containing Salt  \\n      In a method for producing chitosan-containing salt according to the prior art, chitosan, lactic acid and natural sea salt are mixed with each other to prepare a mixture solution. The mixture solution is dried by evaporation, and then subjected to grinding, screening and packaging steps.

Patent Application No.091135066, filed Dec. 3, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.  \\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0002] The present invention relates to a leakage detecting method and, more particularly, to a leakage detecting method for use in an oxidizing system of forming oxide layers. The present invention also relates to a method for estimating a thickness of an oxide layer formed on a wafer.  \\n       [0003] The growth of silicon dioxide layer is very important for achieving high quality of the integrated circuits. Generally, two processes are widely used to form silicon dioxide layers. One process is employed to form native oxide layers, and the other process is used to form thermal oxide layers.  \\n       [0004] The process for forming a native oxide layer is performed by exposing a silicon wafer to an oxygen-containing atmosphere such as oxygen gas or steam at about room temperature. The native oxide layer grows very slowly and generally has a thickness of about 10 to 20 \\u212b. The mechanism for forming a native oxide layer can be illustrated as one of the following reactions:  \\n       Si(s)+O 2 (g)\\u2192SiO 2 (s)\\u2003\\u2003(1)  \\n       Si(s)+2H 2 O(g)\\u2192SiO 2 (s)+2H 2 (g)\\u2003\\u2003(2)  \\n       [0005] The formulae (1) and (2) are usually referred to as dry oxidation and wet oxidation, respectively. Under some circumstances, native oxide layers are useful for enhancing interface properties between the surface of a semiconductor substrate and an insulator layer so as to provide high-quality electrical insulators for electrical isolation of a semiconductor device. Under some circumstances, due to many polar groups carried by the native oxide layers, some organic molecules having polar groups might be bonded to native oxide layers via hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic bonds. As the thicknesses of the native oxide layers increase to some extent, their interface properties will decrease and their irregular morphology might lead to the increase of surface roughness. Therefore, the growth of the native oxide layer needs to be stopped when the thickness reaches about 20 \\u212b.  \\n       [0006] The process for forming a thermal oxide layer is performed at a temperature ranging from about 700\\u00b0 C. to about 1200\\u00b0 C. by dry oxidation or wet oxidation as described above. Depending on applications of the semiconductor devices, the thermal oxide layer generally has a thickness of about 300 to about 20,000 \\u212b. The thermal oxide layers are suitable for use in forming, for example, a field oxide layer, a dielectric layer, a gate oxide layer, and the like.  \\n       [0007]FIG. 1 is a schematic view illustrating a typical oxidizing system for forming an oxide layer on a wafer by means of a wet oxidation process. Such an oxidizing system comprises a quartz furnace tube  11 , a torch  12 , a steam chamber  13  and a piping system. The piping system principally comprises some feeding pipes for introducing reacting gases and purge gas, and an exhaust pipe (not shown) for discharging exhaust gases. The reacting gases generally comprise hydrogen gas (H 2 ) and oxygen gas (O 2 ) for a wet oxidation process. Alternatively, for a dry oxidation process, only oxygen gas is required for forming oxide layers. The purge gas such as nitrogen (N 2 ) is employed to purge the whole oxidizing system prior to feeding the reacting gases. The valves V 1 , V 2  and V 3  in the feeding pipes are used to control the open/close states or flow rates of the nitrogen gas, hydrogen gas and oxygen gas, respectively. The exhaust pipe is usually installed from a top vent of the quartz furnace tube  11  for discharging the exhaust gas after the oxidation.  \\n       [0008]FIG. 2 (including FIGS. 2A and 2B) is flowchart illustrating a process for forming an oxide layer on a wafer according to prior art. Such process comprises two main procedures, i.e., a preliminary procedure and a normal oxidizing procedure. The preliminary procedure is performed for ascertaining whether there is a leakage of the overall oxidizing system. The preliminary procedure is described as follows and is shown with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2A. First, a plurality of test wafers are placed into the quartz furnace tube  11  which serves as an oxidizing chamber (Step S 11 ). Then, the valves V 2  and V 3  are closed, and the valve V 1  is kept open (Step S 12 ). In Step S 13 , nitrogen is introduced into the oxidizing system at a specified flow rate so as to purge the overall oxidizing system for about 5 minutes. Then, the quartz furnace tube  11  is heated to an operating temperature for forming oxide layers on the test wafers, e.g., 800 to 1000\\u00b0 C., and maintained at such temperature for about 10 to 20 minutes (Step S 14 ). Then, the temperature of the quartz furnace tube  11  is decreased to about room temperature for about 1 to 1.5 hours (Step S 15 ). Then, as shown in Step S 16 , the test wafers are removed from the quartz furnace tube  11 , and an average thickness d of the oxide layers on the test wafers is measured. If the average thickness d is greater than an acceptable thickness, e.g., 20 \\u212b, it indicates that some leakages might be generated in the piping system or associated connectors. Meanwhile, the actual locations of leakages need to be detected. In addition, some remedial measures should be taken to prevent leakage, such as re-tightening the connectors and/or welding the pipes. To assure that there is no additional leakage in the oxidizing system, the steps S 11  to S 16  should be repeated.  \\n       [0009] Alternatively, if the average thickness d is less than the acceptable thickness, it means that no leakage occurs in the oxidizing system. At that time, the normal oxidizing procedure will be performed, as described below with reference to FIGS. 2B.  \\n       [0010] First, a batch of working wafers for forming thereon oxide layers are placed into the quartz furnace tube  11  (Step S 21 ). Then, the valves V 2  and V 3  are closed, and the valve V 1  is kept open (Step S 22 ), and nitrogen is subsequently introduced into the oxidizing system at a specified flow rate so as to purge the overall oxidizing system for about 5 minutes (Step S 23 ). Then, the quartz furnace tube  11  is heated to an operating temperature for forming oxide layers on the working wafers, e.g., 800 to 1000\\u00b0 C., and maintained at such temperature for about 10 to 20 minutes (Step S 24 ). Then, the valve V 1  is closed, and the valves V 2  and V 3  are opened in order to introduce oxygen and hydrogen gases into the torch  12  (Step S 25 ). The oxygen and hydrogen gases combined in the torch  12  will ignite and burn to produce steam. The steam enters the steam chamber  13  and the quartz furnace tube  11 . Depending on the application, the processing time is controlled to form a desirable thickness for each oxide layer on the working wafers (Step S 26 ).  \\n       [0011] The above-mentioned preliminary procedure has some drawbacks. For example, the preliminary procedure is time-consuming for detecting leakage of the overall oxidizing system, because the average oxide layer thickness of the test wafers is obtained after the quartz furnace tube  11  has been cooled down. In addition, if some leakages are likely to be generated, it is necessary to re-tighten the connectors and/or weld the pipes and carry out the above preliminary procedure again until no leakage is detected. That is to say, when some leakages occur, the preliminary procedure will be carried out at least two times. Since every preliminary procedure takes about 1.5-2 hours, it takes a relatively long time period, e.g., approximately 0.5 to 1.0 day, and wastes a substantial number of test wafers for testing the leaking condition. Therefore, there is a need to develop an improved process for detecting leaking condition of the oxidizing system so as to overcome the above-mentioned problems.  \\n       BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0012] Embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing a leakage detecting method for use in an oxidizing system of forming an oxide layer so as to shorten leakage detecting time period. A method is also provided for estimating a thickness of an oxide layer formed on a wafer.  \\n       [0013] In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a leakage detecting method for use in an oxidizing system of forming an oxide layer comprises performing oxidizing processes on a plurality of test wafers in a plurality of test runs under a specified operating condition in an oxidizing system having an oxidizing chamber to form oxide layers on the test wafers having a plurality of oxide thicknesses for the plurality of test runs by flowing an oxidizing gas through the oxidizing chamber containing the test wafers. An oxygen concentration of the oxidizing gas exiting the oxidizing chamber is measured in each of the plurality of test runs. The method further comprises obtaining a correlation between the measured oxygen concentrations and the oxide thicknesses for the plurality of test runs to identify a threshold oxygen concentration corresponding to a maximum acceptable oxide thickness. An oxygen concentration greater than the threshold oxygen concentration indicates gas leakage in the oxidizing system.  \\n       [0014] In some embodiments, the oxygen concentration of the oxidizing gas exiting the oxidizing chamber is measured by an oxygen analyzer disposed downstream of the oxidizing chamber. The oxide thickness for each test run is an average oxide thickness of the oxide thicknesses on a plurality of test wafers in the test run. The maximum acceptable oxide thickness is about 20 \\u212b. The specified operating condition comprises a temperature from about 700\\u00b0 C. to 1200\\u00b0 C. and an oxidizing time period from about 10 to 20 minutes.  \\n       [0015] In specific embodiments, the method further comprises performing an oxidizing process on at least one working wafer under the specified operating condition in the oxidizing system to form an oxide layer on the at least one working wafer by flowing an oxidizing gas through the oxidizing chamber containing the at least one working wafer, measuring an oxygen concentration of the oxidizing gas exiting the oxidizing chamber, and determining whether there is gas leakage in the oxidizing system by comparing the measured oxygen concentration with the threshold oxygen concentration multiplied by a safety factor. There is no gas leakage in the oxidizing system when the measured oxygen concentration is lower than the threshold oxygen concentration multiplied by the safety factor. The safety factor may be about 0.9. An inert gas is introduced into the oxidizing system to purge the oxidizing system prior to performing the oxidizing process on the at least one working wafer. The inert gas comprises nitrogen.  \\n       [0016] The method may include at least one of re-tightening one or more connectors and welding one or more pipes in the oxidizing system, upon detecting a gas leakage in the oxidizing system when the measured oxygen concentration is greater than the threshold oxygen concentration multiplied by the safety factor. The method may further include estimating a thickness of the oxide layer on the at least one working wafer based on the measured oxygen concentration of the oxidizing gas exiting the oxidizing chamber and the correlation between the measured oxygen concentration and the oxide thicknesses.  \\n       [0017] In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method for estimating a thickness of an oxide layer formed on a wafer comprises providing an oxidizing system having an oxidizing chamber for forming an oxide layer on one or more substrates by flowing an oxidizing gas through the oxidizing chamber. A working wafer is placed in the oxidizing chamber of the oxidizing system. An oxidizing process is performed on the working wafer under the specified operating condition to form an oxide layer on the working wafer by flowing the oxidizing gas through the oxidizing chamber. The method further comprises measuring an oxygen concentration of the oxidizing gas exiting the oxidizing chamber, and estimating a thickness of said oxide layer according to the measured oxygen concentration and a previously determined relation between oxide layer thicknesses formed on test substrates placed in the oxidizing chamber and oxygen concentrations of gases exiting the oxidizing chamber in test runs of oxidizing processes performed on the test substrates under a specified operating condition.  \\n       [0018] In some embodiments, the method further comprises, prior to placing the working wafer in the oxidizing chamber, performing a checking procedure to ascertain that there is no leakage in the oxidizing system according to the previously determined relation between oxide layer thicknesses formed on test substrates placed in the oxidizing chamber and oxygen concentrations of gases exiting the oxidizing chamber. Performing the checking procedure comprises placing a working wafer in the oxidizing chamber of the oxidizing system, performing an oxidizing process on the working wafer under the specified operating condition to form an oxide layer on the working wafer by flowing the oxidizing gas through the oxidizing chamber, measuring an oxygen concentration of the oxidizing gas exiting the oxidizing chamber, and determining whether there is gas leakage in the oxidizing system by comparing the measured oxygen concentration with the threshold oxygen concentration multiplied by a safety factor. There is no gas leakage in the oxidizing system when the measured oxygen concentration is lower than the threshold oxygen concentration multiplied by the safety factor. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0019]FIG. 1 is a schematic view illustrating a typical oxidizing system for forming an oxide layer on a wafer;  \\n     [0020]FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a process for forming an oxide layer on a wafer according to prior art, wherein FIG. 2A is the flowchart showing the preliminary procedure, and FIG. 2B is the flowchart showing the normal oxidizing procedure;  \\n     [0021]FIG. 3 is a schematic view illustrating an oxidizing system for forming an oxide layer on a wafer according to an embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0022]FIG. 4 is schematic plot illustrating an oxide layer thickness vs. oxygen concentration detected by an oxygen analyzer in an embodiment of the invention; and  \\n     [0023]FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a process for forming an oxide layer on a wafer according to an embodiment of the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n     [0024]FIG. 3 schematically illustrates an embodiment of an oxidizing system used in the present invention to form an oxide layer on a wafer. The elements corresponding to those of FIG. 1 are designated by identical numeral references, and detailed description thereof is omitted. The oxidizing system shown in FIG. 3 comprises a quartz furnace tube  11 , a torch  12 , a steam chamber  13 , an oxygen analyzer  14  and a piping system. The oxygen analyzer  14  may be installed in a bypass of an exhaust pipe  110 . The operating principle of the oxygen analyzer is well known in the art.  \\n     [0025] By utilizing the oxygen analyzer  14 , the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gases from the quartz furnace tube  11  could be on-line detected. Furthermore, the purposes of minimizing the test wafers and reducing time period for testing leaking conditions can be achieved accordingly. The utility of the oxygen analyzer is described in greater details as follows.  \\n     [0026] In advance, a diagram illustrating a relation between oxide layer thickness and oxygen concentration is obtained by performing test runs on a plurality of batches of test wafers. First, a first batch of test wafers is placed into the quartz furnace tube  11 . The valves V 2  and V 3  are closed, and the valve V 1  is kept open. Nitrogen gas is introduced into the oxidizing system at a specified flow rate, e.g., about 6,000 to 10,000 sccm, so as to purge the overall oxidizing system for about 5 minutes. Then, the quartz furnace tube  11  is heated to an operating temperature for forming oxide layers on the test wafers, e.g., about 800 to 1000\\u00b0 C., and maintained at such temperature for about 10 to 20 minutes so as to form an oxide layer on each of the test wafers. Meanwhile, a reference oxygen concentration C 1  of the exhaust gas is detected by the oxygen analyzer  14 . Then, the temperature of the quartz furnace tube  11  is decreased to about room temperature for about 1 to 1.5 hours. The first batch of test wafers is removed from the quartz furnace tube  11 , and an average thickness d 1  of the oxide layers on the test wafers is measured. After changing flow rates of the nitrogen gases, the above-mentioned procedures are repeated for the same oxidizing system by successively placing second, third, fourth, . . . , and nth batches of test wafers into the quartz furnace tube  11 , and detecting other reference oxygen concentrations C 2 , C 3 , C 4 , . . . , Cn and average oxide layer thicknesses d 2 , d 3 , d 4 , . . . , dn for each batch of test wafers, respectively. The relation of reference oxygen concentration (C) and reference oxide layer thickness (d) is plotted in a diagram as shown in FIG. 4.  \\n     [0027] As shown in FIG. 4, the oxygen concentrations of exhaust gases are positively related to the average oxide layer thickness of the test wafers. As previously described, the thickness of a wafer prior to performing a normal oxidizing procedure should be controlled below an acceptable thickness, e.g., 20 \\u212b. Referring to FIG. 4, the acceptable thickness is correlated to an acceptable oxygen concentration C* of the exhaust gas. In addition, when experimental errors are taken into account, approximately 90% or less than 90% of the acceptable oxygen concentration C* may be used as a threshold value. That is to say, when a measured oxygen concentration is less than the threshold value (0.9C*), it is assured that no leakage occur in the oxidizing system, and thus the normal oxidizing procedure can be performed.  \\n     [0028] After the threshold value is obtained, the process for forming an oxide layers on a wafer to be oxidized can be simplified as follows.  \\n     [0029] In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the process for forming an oxide layer on a wafer to be oxidized comprises a checking procedure and a normal oxidizing procedure. The checking procedure is done for a purpose of detecting leakage of the overall oxidizing system, and replaces the preliminary procedure in the prior art. The checking procedure of the present invention is more convenient than the preliminary procedure in the prior art. In a case that the oxidizing system has not been operated for a relatively long time period, the checking procedure will be performed in order to check the overall oxidizing system. However, no test wafers are needed in such checking procedure. The steps for performing the checking procedure are illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 5 and described as follows in details. First, the valves V 2  and V 3  are closed, and the valve V 1  is kept open (Step S 41 ). Nitrogen gas is introduced into the oxidizing system at a specified flow rate to purge the overall oxidizing system for a period of time (e.g., about 5 minutes). The specified flow rate may be substantially the same as that used for the test wafers (Step S 42 ). Then, the quartz furnace tube  11  is heated to an operating temperature for forming oxide layers on the test wafers, e.g., about 800 to 1000\\u00b0 C., and maintained at such temperature typically for about 10 to 20 minutes so as to form an oxide layer on each of the test wafers. Meanwhile, an oxygen concentration C of the exhaust gas is detected by the oxygen analyzer  14  (Step S 43 ). If the detected oxygen concentration C is greater than the threshold value, e.g., 0.9C*, some regular remedial measures are carried out to prevent leakage, such as re-tightening the connectors and/or welding the pipes. Then, the steps S 41  to S 43  are repeated until the oxygen concentration detected by the oxygen analyzer is less than the threshold value. At that time, the general normal oxidizing procedure, i.e., the steps S 21  to S 26 , may proceed so as to form oxide layers on the working wafers.  \\n     [0030] As will be apparent from the above descriptions according to the present invention, the checking procedure of the present invention can be applied to estimate thicknesses of oxide layers by on-line detecting oxygen concentration. Furthermore, the checking procedure has some advantages. One advantage is that no test wafers need to be placed into the oxidizing system for performing the checking procedure. Instead, the oxygen concentration detected by the oxygen analyzer is an indication of a possible leaking condition. Every detecting course typically takes approximately 5 minutes. Since no test wafer is required to be removed, the quartz furnace tube  11  will no longer need to be cooled down for measuring oxide layer thickness. Every cooling course takes about 1 to 1.5 hours. Especially when some leakages are detected, the advantages of the present checking procedure become more apparent. Therefore, the checking procedure of the present invention is more user-friendly, time-saving and cost-effective.  \\n     [0031] The present invention is illustrated by referring to a wet oxidation process. Nevertheless, the present invention can be applied to a dry oxidation process for forming oxide layers. Furthermore, the relation between oxide layer thickness and oxygen concentration will need to be re-determined once the quartz furnace tube refreshes a new one or the associated oxidizing condition varies. In some cases, the relation plot can be provided by suppliers of quartz furnace tubes.  \\n     [0032] While the invention has been described in terms of what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention needs not be limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims which are to be accorded with the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar structures.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004170881-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A low-cost fuel cell separator having a metallic substrate which is able to stably maintain low electric resistance (high electrical conductivity) and high corrosion resistance for a long period is provided.

Field of the Invention  \\n       [0003] The invention relates to a fuel cell separator and production method therefor and, more particularly, to a structure of a surface-treated layer of a metal separator for a solid polymer electrolyte type fuel cell.  \\n       [0004] 2. Description of the Related Art  \\n       [0005] A solid polymer electrolyte type fuel cell battery is formed by stacking modules each of which is formed by stacking at least one cell made up of a membrane-electrode assembly (hereinafter, referred to as \\u201cMEA\\u201d) and a separator.  \\n       [0006] Each MEA is made up of an electrolyte membrane formed by an ion-exchange membrane, an electrode (anode) formed by a catalyst layer that is disposed on a surface of the electrolyte membrane, and an electrode (cathode) formed by a catalyst layer that is disposed on another surface of the electrolyte membrane. Normally, a diffusion layer is provided between the MEA and the separator. The diffusion layer facilitates the diffusion of a reaction gas into the catalyst layer. The separator has a fuel gas channel for supplying a fuel gas (hydrogen) to the anode, and an oxidizing gas channel for supplying an oxidizing gas (oxygen, or air in ordinary cases) to the cathode. The separator forms a passageway of electrons between adjacent cells.  \\n       [0007] Terminals (electrode plates), insulators, and end plates are disposed on two opposite ends of a cell stack in the cell stacking direction. The cell stack is clamped in the cell stacking direction, and is fixed through the use of fastener members (e.g., tension plates) that extend outside the cell stack in the cell stacking direction, and also through the use of bolts and nuts. In this manner, a stack is formed. On the anode side of a solid polymer electrolyte type fuel cell, a reaction occurs in which hydrogen is separated into hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons. The hydrogen ions migrate through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode side. On the cathode side, the hydrogen ions participate in a reaction with oxygen and electrons (i.e., electrons produced on the anode side of the adjacent MEA come to the cathode through the separator, or electrons produced on the anode side of the cell disposed at an end of the cell stack come to the cathode of the cell at the opposite end via an external circuit), thereby producing water.  \\n       [0008] Anode side: H 2 \\u21922H + +2e \\u2212   \\n       [0009] Cathode side: 2H + +2e \\u2212 +(\\u00bd)O 2 \\u2192H 2 O  \\n       [0010] Since the separators need to have electrical conductivity, separators are normally formed of a metal, carbon, or an electrically conductive resin, or are formed by a combination of a metal separator and a resin frame. Carbon separators and electrically conductive resin separators are chemically stable and therefore maintain electrical conductivity even during contact with acid water. However, due to a strength requirement of bottom surfaces of channels formed in separators, the carbon separators and electrically conductive resin separators need to have relatively great thickness, thus resulting in an increased stack length. In contrast, the metal separators, having relatively high strength, can be made relatively thin despite grooves and ridges being formed to provide channels. Thus, the stack length can be reduced. However, corrosion by acid water becomes a problem leading to a reduced electrical conductivity and a reduced output. That is, to adopt metal separators, it is necessary that the metal separators be able to maintain good electrical conductivity and good corrosion resistance for a long period.  \\n       [0011] As a related-art technology, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-93538 discloses a technology in which a surface of a substrate (stainless steel) of a metal separator of a fuel cell is provided with an electrically conductive film and an acid-resistant film of a metal material different from that of the substrate.  \\n       [0012] However, the conventional metal separator has a problem of increased cost since the acid-resistant film and the substrate are formed from different metal materials.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0013] An aspect of the invention provides a separator for a fuel cell. This fuel cell separator includes a metal substrate having an oxide film forming a surface of the substrate and made by an oxidization of a material of the substrate and an electrically conductive thin film formed on a surface of the oxide film. Another aspect of the invention provides a production method for a fuel cell separator. The production method includes the step of forming, on a surface of a substrate, an oxide film from a material of the substrate, and the step of forming an electrically conductive thin film on a surface of the oxide film. According to the fuel cell separator and the production method described above, the electrically conductive thin film achieves low electrical resistance (high electrical conductivity), and the oxide film substantially prevents or reduces elution from the separator substrate and therefore achieves high corrosion resistance even if the electrically conductive thin film has pinholes. Furthermore, since the oxide film is an oxide film made by an oxidization of a material of the substrate, the formation of the oxide film costs less than the formation of an oxide film by an oxidization of a different material. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0014] The above mentioned embodiment and other embodiments, objects, features, advantages, technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of the exemplary embodiments of the invention, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:  \\n     [0015]FIG. 1 is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of a fuel cell separator in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the invention;  \\n     [0016]FIG. 2 is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of a fuel cell separator in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the invention;  \\n     [0017]FIG. 3 is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of a fuel cell separator in accordance with Embodiment 3 of the invention;  \\n     [0018]FIG. 4 is a sectional view illustrating the performance of a corrosion resistance test (couple electric current test method) of a fuel cell separator of the invention;  \\n     [0019]FIG. 5 is a bar graph indicating results of the corrosion resistance test of fuel cell separators of the invention (the amounts of ion elution from test pieces  1  of Condition  1  to Condition  5 );  \\n     [0020]FIG. 6 is a bar graph indicating results of the corrosion resistance test of fuel cell separators of the invention (the amounts of ion elution from test pieces  2  of Condition  1  to Condition  4 );  \\n     [0021]FIG. 7 is a sectional view illustrating the performance of an electrical conductivity test (contact electrical resistance test method) of a fuel cell separator of the invention;  \\n     [0022]FIG. 8 is a bar graph indicating results of the electrical conductivity test of fuel cell separators of the invention (the contact electrical resistances of test pieces  1  of Condition  1  to Condition  5  before and after the corrosion);  \\n     [0023]FIG. 9 is a bar graph indicating results of the electrical conductivity test of fuel cell separators of the invention (the contact electrical resistances of test pieces  2  of Condition  1  to Condition  4  before and after the corrosion);  \\n     [0024]FIG. 10 is a conceptual bar graph indicating the proportions of the contact electrical resistance between the layers or the specific resistance of the layers of each of fuel cell separator test pieces of Condition  1 , Condition  4  and Condition  5  determined from the electrical conductivity test;  \\n     [0025]FIG. 11 is a sectional view illustrating the performance of an adhesion test (a test method using water jet) of a fuel cell separator of the invention;  \\n     [0026]FIG. 12 is a bar graph indicating results of the adhesion test of fuel cell separators of the invention (the rates of remaining Au thin film in test pieces  1  of Condition  2  to Condition  5  before and after the adhesion test);  \\n     [0027]FIG. 13 is a bar graph indicating results of the adhesion test of fuel cell separators of the invention (the rates of remaining C thin film in test pieces  2  of Condition  2  to Condition  4  before and after the adhesion test); and  \\n     [0028]FIG. 14A shows sectional views of variation I in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0029]FIG. 14B shows sectional views of variation II in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0030]FIG. 14C shows sectional views of variation III in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0031]FIG. 14D shows sectional views of variation IV in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0032]FIG. 14E shows sectional views of variation V in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0033]FIG. 14F shows sectional views of variation VI in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0034]FIG. 14G shows sectional views of variation VII in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0035]FIG. 14H shows sectional views of variation VIII in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0036]FIG. 14I shows sectional views of variation IX in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0037]FIG. 14J shows sectional views of variation X in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0038]FIG. 14K shows sectional views of variation XI in fuel cell separators of the invention.  \\n     [0039]FIG. 14L shows sectional views of variation XII in fuel cell separators of the invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0040] In the following description and the accompanying drawings, the present invention will be described in more detail in terms of exemplary embodiments.  \\n     [0041]FIG. 1 illustrates Embodiment 1 (in which the electrically conductive thin film is a metal thin film) of the invention. FIG. 2 illustrates Embodiment 2 (in which the electrically conductive thin film is a carbon thin film formed of carbon (C) at an atomic level) of the invention. FIG. 3 illustrates Embodiment 3 (in which a carbon coating film is formed on the electrically conductive thin film) of the invention. FIGS.  4  to  13  indicate specifications of tests and results of the tests. In Embodiments 1 to 3 of the invention, like portions are represented by like reference characters in the drawings.  \\n     [0042] The same or similar portions of Embodiments 1 to 3 of the invention will first be described. Fuel cell batteries incorporating separators to which the invention is applied are installed in fuel cell motor vehicles and the like. However, such fuel cell batteries may also be installed in other vehicles or apparatuses. The fuel cells incorporating separators to which the invention is applied are solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The structure of a stack formed by stacking MEAs and separators conforms to the structure of ordinary solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell batteries described above in conjunction with the related-art technology.  \\n     [0043] A fuel cell separator  10  in accordance with the invention is a metal separator as shown in FIG. 1 which has a metal substrate  11  that has, on a surface thereof, an oxide film (passive film)  11   a  made by an oxidization of a material of the substrate, and an electrically conductive thin film  12  formed on a surface of the oxide film  11   a  of the substrate  11 . Examples of the metal material of the separator substrate  11  include stainless steel (SUS), steel, aluminum (Al), aluminum alloys, titanium (Ti), titanium alloys, etc. Examples of the material of the oxide film  11   a  in the case where the substrate  11  is made of stainless steel include Cr 2 O 3 , NiO, Fe 2 O 3 , etc. If the substrate is made of Al, the oxide film  11   a  may be made of Al 2 O 3 . If the substrate is made of Ti, the oxide film  11   a  may be made of TiO 2 . If the substrate is made of steel, the oxide film  11   a  may be made of Fe 2 O 3 . The oxide film  11   a  may be formed naturally by letting the substrate  11  stand in air, or may also be formed by placing the substrate  11  in an oxidizing atmosphere (oxidizing solution). The oxide film  11   a  of the substrate improves the corrosion resistant performance of the substrate  11 .  \\n     [0044] The electrically conductive thin film  12  is a metal thin film  12 A, or a carbon thin film  12 B formed of carbon (C) at an atomic level. Examples of the metal forming the metal thin film  12 A include noble metals, an example of which is Au. The carbon thin film  12 B is a film built at an atomic level that is, the film  12 B is bonded to the substrate oxide film  11   a  and the like at an atomic level, and does not include a coating film  14  that is formed of a carbon powder and a resin binder. The noble metals and carbon are highly resistant to corrosion. The thickness of the electrically conductive thin film  12  is of the order of nanometers (nm) (it is to be noted that the range of 0.01 to 10 \\u03bcm is appropriate), and is less than the thickness of the coating film  14 , which is several ten micrometers (\\u03bcm). The electrically conductive thin film  12  may be formed by CVD (chemical vapor deposition) or PVD (physical vapor deposition), including vapor deposition, sputtering, ion plating, etc. To form the metal-based thin film  12 A, plating may also be employed.  \\n     [0045] It is desirable that an intermediate layer  13  for enhancing the adhesion and the corrosion resistance be formed between the oxide film  11   a  of the substrate and the electrically conductive thin film  12 . The formation of the intermediate layer  13  on the oxide film  11   a  of the substrate is desirable for increasing adhesion and corrosion resistance because the provision of the electrically conductive thin film  12 Alone will result in insufficient corrosion resistance and insufficient adhesion. The provision of the intermediate layer  13  alone will also result in insufficient corrosion resistance and insufficient adhesion. Therefore, it is also desirable to form the electrically conductive thin film  12  on the intermediate layer.  \\n     [0046] As for the intermediate layer  13 , a material and a structure are selected so as to achieve good adhesion to the substrate oxide film  11   a  and good bonding characteristic thereto, that is, good bonding characteristic to oxygen atom (O), and so as to achieve good adhesion and good bonding characteristic to the electrically conductive thin film  12 . If the electrically conductive thin film  12  is a metal thin film  12 A as shown in FIG. 1, an Me layer  13   a  formed of at least one element selected from the group consisting of the metal elements of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W and the metalloid elements of Si and B is selected as an intermediate layer  13 . These elements have good bonding characteristics to oxygen, and have good adhesion and good bonding characteristic to the oxide film  11   a  of the substrate. The intermediate layer  13  has good bonding characteristic to the metal thin film  12 A since the intermediate layer  13  is formed of metal or metalloid. If the electrically conductive thin film  12  is a carbon thin film  12 B formed of carbon (C) at the atomic level, a layer formed by at least one of the following two types of layers is selected as the intermediate layer  13 . The two types of layers are: (a) a Me layer  13   a  formed of at least one element selected from the metal elements of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W and the metalloid elements of Si and B; (b) a (carbon-Me) gradient layer  13   b  which is formed on top of the Me layer  13   a  and which contains carbon (C) and an element (Me) of metal or metalloid and in which the proportion of carbon (C) increases with increasing distance from the substrate  11 . The layer  13   a  of type (a) has good bonding characteristics to oxygen atom, and has good adhesion and good bonding characteristics to the substrate oxide film  11   a.  The layer  13   b  of type (b) has good bonding characteristics to the layer  13   a  of type (a), and has good adhesion and good bonding characteristics to the carbon thin film  12 B.  \\n     [0047] As shown in FIG. 3, a carbon (c) coating film  14  may be formed on top of the electrically conductive thin film  12 . In that case, the structure of the surface-treated layer is formed by the substrate  11 , the substrate oxide film  11   a  on a substrate surface, the intermediate layer  13  provided if necessary, the electrically conductive thin film  12  formed by the metal thin film  12 A or the carbon thin film  12 B formed of carbon (C) at the atomic level, and the C coating film  14  in that order. However, the provision of the C coating film  14  is not essential.  \\n     [0048] If the electrically conductive thin film  12  is the carbon thin film  12 B built of carbon (C) at the atomic level as shown in FIG. 2, the intermediate layer  13  and the carbon thin film  12 B may be formed as in Variations (modifications) I to XII shown in FIG. 14. In FIG. 14, the term \\u201cmetal separator\\u201d refers to a unit of the substrate  11  and the substrate oxide film  11   a  provided on the surface of the substrate  11 . Furthermore, \\u201cMe\\u201d indicates a layer formed of at least one element selected from the metal elements of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W and the metalloid elements of Si and B. The term \\u201cMeC\\u201d indicates a carbide of the aforementioned Me element. The \\u201cMeC gradient layer\\u201d is a layer in which the composition changes from Me to C in a gradient fashion in the direction of thickness. A combination of two kinds of elements, such as \\u201cMe(A)\\u201d and \\u201cMe(B)\\u201d where Me(A)=W (tungsten), Me(B)\\u2550Cr (chrome), and a combination of more than two kinds of elements are also possible. The \\u201ccarbon+Me or MeC layer\\u201d is a layer in which Me or MeC is compounded by an atomic level fabrication in an outermost surface carbon layer. The symbol \\u201c+\\u201d indicates compounding.  \\n     [0049] Variations I to XII shown in FIG. 14 will be described.  \\n     [0050] Variation I is formed of a metal separator, an Me or MeC layer, a carbon-Me or MeC gradient layer, and a carbon layer (C thin film).  \\n     [0051] Variation II is formed of a metal separator, a carbon-Me or MeC gradient layer, and a carbon layer (C thin film).  \\n     [0052] Variation III is formed of a metal separator, an Me or MeC layer, and a carbon layer (C thin film).  \\n     [0053] Variation IV is formed of a metal separator, and a carbon-Me or MeC gradient layer.  \\n     [0054] Variation V is formed of a metal separator, an Me(B) or Me(B)C layer, an Me(A) or Me(A)C-Me(B) or Me(B)C gradient layer, a carbon-Me(A) or Me(A)C gradient layer, and a carbon layer (C thin film).  \\n     [0055] Variation VI is formed of a metal separator, an Me(A) or Me(A)C-Me(B) or Me(B)C gradient layer, a carbon-Me(A) or Me(A)C gradient layer, and a carbon layer (C thin film).  \\n     [0056] Variation VII is formed of a metal separator, an Me(B) or Me(B)C layer, an Me(A) or Me(A)C layer, and a carbon layer (C thin film).  \\n     [0057] Variation VIII is formed of a metal separator, an Me(A) or Me(A)C-Me(B) or Me(B)C gradient layer, a carbon-Me(A) or Me(A)C gradient layer, and a carbon layer (C thin film).  \\n     [0058] Variation IX is formed of a metal separator, an Me or MeC layer, a carbon+Me or MeC-Me or MeC gradient layer, and a carbon+Me or MeC layer.  \\n     [0059] Variation X is formed of a metal separator, a carbon+Me or MeC-Me or MeC gradient layer, and a carbon+Me or MeC layer.  \\n     [0060] Variation XI is formed of a metal separator, an Me or MeC layer, and a carbon+Me or MeC layer.  \\n     [0061] Variation XII is formed of a metal separator, and a carbon+Me or MeC-Me or MeC gradient layer.  \\n     [0062] Constructions of various embodiments of the invention will next be described.  \\n     Embodiment 1  \\n     [0063] A fuel cell separator  10  in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the invention includes a metal substrate  11  having, on its surface, an oxide film  11   a  made by an oxidization of a material of the substrate itself, an intermediate layer  13  formed on the substrate  11 , and an electrically conductive thin film  12  formed on the intermediate layer  13 . The electrically conductive thin film  12  is a metal thin film  12 A. The intermediate layer  13  is a Me layer  13   a  formed of at least one element selected from the metal elements of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W and the metalloid elements of Si and B.  \\n     Embodiment 2  \\n     [0064] A fuel cell separator  10  in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the invention includes a metal substrate  11  having, on its surface, an oxide film  11   a  made by an oxidization of a material of the substrate itself, an intermediate layer  13  formed on the substrate  11 , and an electrically conductive thin film  12  formed on the intermediate layer  13 .

The intermediate layer  13  is formed by at least one the following two layers: a layer (Me)  13   a  formed of at least one element selected from the metal elements of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W and the metalloid elements of Si and B; and a (carbon-Me) gradient layer  13   b  which is formed on top of the layer (Me)  13   a  and which contains carbon (C) and an element (Me) of metal or metalloid and in which the compounding proportion of carbon (C) increases with increasing distance from the substrate.  \\n     Embodiment 3  \\n     [0065] In a fuel cell separator  10  in accordance with Embodiment 3 of the invention, a C coating film  14  is formed on the electrically conductive thin film  12  of a fuel cell separator similar to the separator of Embodiment 1 or 2 of the invention.  \\n     [0066] Operation of the invention will next be described. In the fuel cell separator  10  in accordance with the invention, the substrate  11  of the metal separator has, on its surface, the oxide film  11   a  made by an oxidization of a material of the substrate itself, and the oxide film  11   a  has, on its surface, the electrically conductive thin film  12 . Therefore, low electrical resistance is achieved by the electrically conductive thin film  12 , thereby providing a highly electrically conductive separator. Even if the electrically conductive thin film  12  has pinholes, the oxide film  11   a  substantially prevents or reduces elution from the separator substrate  11 , thereby achieving high corrosion resistance of the separator. Furthermore, since the oxide film  1  la is an oxide film made by an oxidization of a material of the substrate  11  itself, the formation of the oxide film  11   a  costs less than the formation of an oxide film from a different metal as in the aforementioned related-art technology (patent literature  1 ).  \\n     [0067] Furthermore, since the intermediate layer  13  for enhancing the adhesion is formed between the oxide film  11   a  of the substrate itself and the electrically conductive thin film  12 , good adhesion of the surface-treated layer  12 ,  13  to the substrate  11  is secured. Therefore, the durability of the separator improves, and high electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance of the separator are maintained for a long period.  \\n     [0068] Furthermore, if the C coating film  14  is formed on the electrically conductive thin film  12  of the surface-treated layer, the reliability associated with durability further improves corresponding to the formation of the C coating film  14 , in addition to improvements of the surface-treated layer in electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance and adhesion.  \\n     [0069] Fuel cell separators  10  in accordance with the invention and comparative examples were tested with respect to corrosion resistance, contact electrical resistance and adhesion. Results of the tests concerning the separators of the invention on the one hand and the comparative examples on the other hand were compared. The comparison confirmed that the fuel cell separators of the invention had sufficiently high corrosion resistance, sufficiently low contact resistance (high electrical conductivity), and high adhesion of the surface-treated layer, compared with the comparative examples. This will be further described in detail below.  \\n     [0070] Test pieces used for the tests will first be described. The separators having an electrically conductive thin film of Au, that is, a noble metal, will be referred to as \\u201ctest pieces 1\\u201d, and the separators having an electrically conductive thin film of carbon (C) will be referred to as \\u201ctest pieces 2\\u201d. In the description below, Condition  4  regarding test pieces  1  and Condition  3  and Condition  4  regarding test pieces  2  represent the invention, and the other conditions represent comparative examples.  \\n     [0071] Test Pieces  1 : Au was used for the electrically conductive thin film  \\n     [0072] &lt;Condition  1 &gt; not treated/substrate is SUS316L (with an oxide film)  \\n     [0073] &lt;Condition  2 &gt; 10 nm Au sputtering (the electrically conductive thin film of Au with a thickness of 10 nm by a sputtering)/substrate is SUS316L (without ion etching (IE), and with an oxide film)  \\n     [0074] &lt;Condition  3 &gt; 10 nm Au sputtering/substrate is SUS316L (with IE in an Ar atmosphere (Ar\\u2014IE), and without an oxide film)  \\n     [0075] &lt;Condition  4  (invention)&gt; 10 nm Au sputtering/10 nm Cr sputtering (the electrically conductive thin film of Cr with a thickness of 10 nm by a sputtering)/substrate is SUS316L (without IE, and with an oxide film)  \\n     [0076] &lt;Condition  5 &gt; 10 nm Au sputtering/10 nm Cr sputtering/substrate is SUS316L (with Ar\\u2014IE, and without an oxide film)  \\n     [0077] Test Pieces  2 : carbon was used for the electrically conductive thin film  \\n     [0078] &lt;Condition  1 &gt; not treated/substrate is SUS316L (with an oxide film)  \\n     [0079] &lt;Condition  2 &gt; 50 nm C sputtering (the electrically conductive thin film of carbon with a thickness of 50 nm by a sputtering)/50 nm C\\u2014Cr gradient sputtering (the carbon-chromium gradient layer, in a proportion of carbon increasing with increasing distance from substrate, with a thickness of 50 nm by a sputtering)/substrate is SUS316L (with Ar\\u2014IE, and without an oxide film)  \\n     [0080] &lt;Condition  3  (invention)&gt; 50 nm C sputtering/50 nm C\\u2014Cr gradient sputtering/substrate is SUS316L (with Ar-light etching (LE, meaning light IE), and with a thin oxide film)  \\n     [0081] &lt;Condition  4  (invention)&gt; 50 nm C sputtering/50 nm C\\u2014Cr gradient sputtering/substrate is SUS316L (without IE, and without a thick oxide film (the same as in Condition  1 ))  \\n     [0082] 1. Corrosion Resistance Test  \\n     [0083] (1) Corrosion Resistance Test Condition  \\n     [0084] The corrosion resistance test was performed by a couple electric current test method illustrated in FIG. 4. A test piece and a counter electrode (a burned carbon, i.e., graphite, contacting the separator in a fuel cell) were placed in an acidic aqueous solution (an acidic aqueous solution simulating an environment to which the separator of a fuel cell is exposed, and a sulfuric acid solution of pH 2 was used in this test). While the temperature was set at 80\\u00b0 C., that is, an operation temperature of the fuel cell, the electric current density at the time of elution of separator metal Me in the form of ions was measured by an ammeter set on an external circuit of the counter electrode. The corrosion time was set at 100 hours. The plus current is a current occurring at the time of elution of Me in the form of positive ions, and means induction of corrosion. Zero or minus current means freedom from problems in corrosion or corrosion resistance.  \\n     [0085] (2) Quantification of Elution of Ions  \\n     [0086] The corrosive solution was analyzed by ICP (induced coupled plasma emission spectroscopy) to determine the quantity of the aforementioned ion elution.  \\n     [0087] (3) Results of Corrosion Resistance Test  \\n     [0088] Results of the test regarding the amount of ion elution from the SUS substrates of the Au thin film type test pieces  1  of Condition  1  to Condition  5  are indicated in FIG. 5. In the bar chart of FIG. 5, the test pieces  1  of Condition  1 , Condition  2 , Condition  3 , Condition  4  and Condition  5  are sequentially indicated from the left. Of the three segments of each bar in FIG. 5, the top segment indicates the amount of Ni elution from the SUS substrate, and the intermediate segment indicates the amount of Cr elution from the SUS substrate, and the bottom segment indicates the amount of Fe elution from the SUS substrate. With regard to the test piece  1  of the invention of Condition  4 , the amounts of elution of Ni, Cr and Fe ions were less than the measuring range lower limit, and can be considered substantially no elution.  \\n     [0089] Results of the test regarding the amount of ion elution from the SUS substrates of the C thin film type test pieces  2  under Condition  1  to Condition  4  are indicated in FIG. 6. In the bar chart of FIG. 6, the test pieces  2  of Condition  1 , Condition  2 , Condition  3  and Condition  4  are indicated sequentially from the left. Of the three segments of each bar in FIG. 6, the top segment indicates the amount of Ni elution from the SUS substrate, and the intermediate segment indicates the amount of Cr elution from the SUS substrate, and the bottom segment indicates the amount of Fe elution from the SUS substrate. With regard to the test pieces of the invention of Condition  3  and Condition  4 , the amounts of elution of Ni, Cr and Fe ions were less than in the cases of the test pieces of Condition  1  and Condition  2 , thus indicating improvements in corrosion resistance.  \\n     [0090] The results of the corrosion resistance test can be summarized as follows.  \\n     [0091] The test pieces of the invention with the oxide film  11   a  had good corrosion resistance (elution resistance), regardless of the presence or absence of the intermediate Cr layer  13 .  \\n     [0092] As for the C thin film type test pieces, the corrosion resistance improved with increases in the amount of the oxide film  11   a  remaining.  \\n     [0093] 2. Electrical Conductivity Test  \\n     [0094] (1) Electrical Conductivity Test Condition  \\n     [0095] The electrical conductivity test was performed by a contact resistance test method illustrated in FIG. 7. The electrical contact resistance was measured before and after the corrosion resistance test. The test pieces used for the resistance measurement were the same as the test pieces  1  of Condition  1  to Condition  5  and the test pieces  2  of Condition  1  to Condition  4  in the aforementioned corrosion resistance test, in which the substrate  11  (having, an oxide film  11   a  on a surface) was surface-treated. Each test piece was sandwiched with an intervening diffusion cloth (a carbon cloth identical to the one incorporated as a diffusion layer in a fuel cell) between polar plates. After the planar contact pressure was set at 20 kgf/cm 2 , which is close to the planar contact pressure of a fuel cell, and the current was set at 1 A, the voltage V between the two polar plates was measured. Then, a contact resistance was determined as in the following equation:  \\n     Resistance  R=V/I ( I= 1 A)  \\n     [0096] (2) Results of Electrical Conductivity Test  \\n     [0097] Results of measurement of the contact electrical resistance of the Au thin film type test pieces  1  of Condition  1  to Condition  5  (the same specifications as in Condition  1  to Condition  5  of the Au thin film type test pieces  1  in the corrosion resistance test) are indicated in FIG. 8. The five pairs of bars in FIG. 8 indicate the test pieces  1  of Condition  1 , Condition  2 , Condition  3 , Condition  4  and Condition  5  in that order from the left. Of the two bars for each condition in FIG. 8, the left side bar indicates the contact resistance before the corrosion, and the right side bar indicates the contact resistance after the corrosion. The test piece of the invention of Condition  4  exhibited low contact resistance.  \\n     [0098] Results of measurement of the contact electrical resistance of the C thin film type test pieces  2  of Condition  1  to Condition  4  (the same specifications as in Condition  1  to Condition  4  of the C thin film type test pieces  2  in the corrosion resistance test) are indicated in FIG. 9. The four pairs of bars in FIG. 9 indicate the test pieces  2  of Condition  1 , Condition  2 , Condition  3  and Condition  4  in that order from the left. Of the two bars for each condition in FIG. 9, the left side bar indicates the contact resistance before the corrosion, and the right side bar indicates the contact resistance after the corrosion. The test pieces of the invention of Condition  3  and Condition  4  exhibited low contact resistance.  \\n     [0099] The results of the electrical conductivity test can be summarized as follows.  \\n     [0100] The results indicate that the surface treatment (formation of the electrically conductive thin film  12 ) achieved lower contact resistances, regardless of the presence or absence of the oxide film  11   a  on the surface of the SUS substrate  11 .  \\n     [0101] The reason for this can be considered as follows. As indicated in the conceptual diagram of FIG. 10, the resistance in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the separator includes the contact resistance between the diffusion layer and the separator, the specific resistance of the substrate oxide film, etc. However, it is the contact resistance between the diffusion layer and the separator that makes up a major portion of the resistance. The specific resistance of the substrate oxide film or the like contributes merely to a small extent since the thickness of the substrate oxide film is as small as several nanometers. Therefore, as the contact resistance between the diffusion layer and the separator is reduced by formation of the electrically conductive thin film  12 , the resistance in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the separator considerably reduces. In contrast, the resistance increase attributed to the oxide film  11   a  does not considerably affect the increase in resistance in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the separator. It is considered that the electrical resistance in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the separator reduces as a whole.  \\n     [0102] Of the three bars shown in FIG. 10, the left side bar indicates the test piece  1  of Condition  1  according to a comparative example, and the middle bar indicates the test piece  1  of Condition  4  according to the invention, and the right side bar indicates the test piece  1  of Condition  5  according to another comparative example. Of the three segments of the bar of the test piece  1  of Condition  1 , the top segment indicates the contact resistance between the diffusion cloth (carbon cloth) and the substrate oxide film, and the intermediate segment indicates the resistance of the substrate oxide film, and the bottom segment indicates the resistance of the SUS substrate. Of the five segments of the bar of the test piece  1  of Condition  4  according to the invention, the first segment from top indicates the contact resistance between the diffusion cloth (carbon cloth) and the electrically conductive thin film, and the second segment from top indicates the resistance of the electrically conductive thin film, and the third segment from top indicates the resistance of a base film (intermediate Me layer), and the fourth segment from top indicates the resistance of the substrate oxide film, and the fifth segment from top indicates the resistance of the SUS substrate. Of the four segments of the bar of the test piece  1  of Condition  5 , the first segment from top indicates the contact resistance between the diffusion cloth (carbon cloth) and the electrically conductive thin film, and the second segment from top indicates the resistance of the electrically conductive thin film, and the third segment from top indicates the resistance of a base film (intermediate Me layer), and the fourth segment from top indicates the resistance of the SUS substrate.  \\n     [0103] 3. Adhesion Test (Test of Adhesion Between the Surface-Treated Layer  12 ,  13  and the Substrate)  \\n     [0104] (1) Adhesion Test Condition  \\n     [0105] The adhesion test was performed by a water jet test method illustrated in FIG. 11. In the test, the water pressure at a nozzle was about 200 MPa (2000 atm.) The rate of thin film remaining in the water jet test was determined as in the following equation:  \\n     Rate of remaining thin film (%)= M /Mo\\u00d7100  \\n     [0106] where  \\n     [0107] M is the amount of thin film after water jet (FIG. 14( b )),  \\n     [0108] M 0  is the amount of thin film before water jet (FIG. 14( a )).  \\n     [0109] Elements were provided by fluorescent X-ray or the like.  \\n     [0110] (2) Results of Adhesion Test  \\n     [0111] Results of the adhesion test of the Au thin film type test pieces  1  of Condition  2  to Condition  5  (the same specifications as in Condition  2  to Condition  5  of the Au thin film type test pieces  1  in the corrosion resistance test) are indicated in FIG. 12. The four pairs of bars of the chart of FIG. 12 indicate the test pieces  1  of Condition  2 , Condition  3 , Condition  4  and Condition  5  in that order from the left. Of the two bars for each condition in FIG. 12, the left side bar indicates the rate of remaining Au thin film before the adhesion test, and the right side bar indicates the rate of remaining Au thin film after the adhesion test. The test piece of Condition  4  according to the invention exhibited high rate of remaining Au thin film (good adhesion).  \\n     [0112] Results of the adhesion test of the C thin film type test pieces  1  of Condition  2  to Condition  4  (the same specifications as in Condition  2  to Condition  4  of the C thin film type test pieces  1  in the corrosion resistance test) are indicated in FIG. 13. The three pairs of bars of the chart of FIG. 13 indicate the test pieces  2  of Condition  2 , Condition  3  and Condition  4  in that order from the left. Of the two bars for each condition in FIG. 13, the left side bar indicates the rate of remaining C thin film before the adhesion test, and the right side bar indicates the rate of remaining C thin film after the adhesion test. The test piece of Condition  3  according to the invention exhibited high rate of remaining C thin film (good adhesion).  \\n     [0113] The results of the adhesion test can be summarized as follows.  \\n     [0114] Before Adhesion Test  \\n     [0115] If a base Me layer  13  is not provided, good adhesion can be secured by removing the oxide film  11   a  via Ar\\u2014IE.  \\n     [0116] If a base Me layer  13   a  is provided, good adhesion can be secured, regardless of the presence or absence of the substrate oxide film  11   a.    \\n     [0117] After Adhesion Test  \\n     [0118] If a base Me layer  13   a  is not provided, the adhesion reduces due to the corrosion of the Au thin film/substrate interface.  \\n     [0119] If a base Me layer  13   a  is provided, good corrosion resistance (due to the barrier effect of the base Me layer and improvement in corrosion resistance caused by the substrate oxide film  11   a ) can be maintained even after the corrosion.  \\n     [0120] In a fuel cell separator in accordance with the invention, an oxide film is formed, on a surface of a metal separator, from a substrate metal, and an electrically conductive thin film is formed on a surface of the oxide film. Therefore, the fuel cell separator achieves low electrical resistance (high electrical conductivity) due to the electrically conductive thin film. Even if the electrically conductive thin film has pinholes, the oxide film substantially prevents or reduces elution from the separator substrate, thereby achieving high corrosion resistance. Furthermore, since the oxide film is an oxide film of the separator substrate itself, the oxide film can be formed at a lower cost than an oxide film formed from a different metal as in the aforementioned related-art technology (patent literature  1 ). Furthermore, in a fuel cell separator in accordance with the invention, an intermediate layer for enhancing adhesion is formed between the oxide film made of an oxidization of the substrate material itself and the electrically conductive thin film, so that good adhesion of the surface-treated layer is secured. Therefore, good durability of the separator is achieved, and high electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance of the separator are maintained for a long period. Still further, in a fuel cell separator in accordance with the invention, a C coating film is formed on top of the electrically conductive thin film. Therefore, the reliability associated with durability further improves corresponding to the formation of the C coating film, in addition to the aforementioned good property of the surface-treated layer (high electrical conductivity).  \\n     [0121] While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments or constructions. To the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements. In addition, while the various elements of the exemplary embodiments are shown in various combinations and configurations, which are exemplary, other combinations and configurations, including more, less or only a single element, are also within the spirit and scope of the invention.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004197363-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The invention relates to a coated granular material wherein the coating comprises the reaction product of (A) an acid-modified fatty (acid) component and (B) an epoxide component.

This method has gained particular importance in the field of fertilizers.  \\n       [0003] In the past, different coating materials have been suggested.  \\n       [0004] The document DE-A-1 242 573 describes a process for encapsulating granulates by spraying them with a liquid coating agent. A copolymerisate of dicyclopentadiene with drying or semidrying oils is suggested as coating agent. However, carrying out this process requires diluting the coating agent with a volatile solvent to provide a free-flowing consistency in order to allow spraying onto the granulate. The added solvent has to be removed during the process at high temperatures. This results in the release of combustible vapors which are harmful to the health. Furthermore, due to drying the time required for a coating process is unfavorably prolonged. On the whole, both the heating and the cooling processes require a very high amount of energy. The release of vapors furthermore necessitates a complicated cleaning process of the exhaust gas.  \\n       [0005] EP-A-0 230 601 describes a method for producing a water-permeable cover on water-soluble granular materials by coating with a synthetic resin. For this purpose, a coating substance is used which comprises a polyisocyanate and a polyol component from a condensation product of phenols and aldehydes, a plasticizer containing hydroxyl groups and optionally a diluent containing hydroxyl groups. The coating substance is cured with an amine as a catalyst. While this method can be carried out at relatively low temperatures, the amines used therein are characterized by a low boiling point and an extremely unpleasant and intensive odor. Therefore, this method as well requires a very thorough, technically very complex and thus also very expensive cleaning of the exhaust gas.  \\n       [0006] U.S. Pat. No. 3,259,482 describes fertilizer granulates having a water-insoluble resin as a coating. The coating is obtained from an epoxidized compound, for example epoxidized fats or epoxidized fatty acid esters and a polyester curing agent. The polyester component is the esterification product of a polyfunctional alcohol and a polyfunctional carboxylic acid. However, for coating the granulate, the resin has to be dissolved in a rapidly drying solvent which has to be removed later on in the process.  \\n       [0007] WO 96/41779 relates to covered fertilizer granulates that are covered with an ethylene copolymerisate having carboxyl groups, wherein the carboxyl groups can also be present in the form of their alkali, alkaline earth or ammonium salts, wherein the ethylene copolymerisate having carboxyl groups is comprised of a) 75 to 90 wt.-% ethylene and b) 10 to 25 wt.-% of an \\u03b1-olefinically unsaturated C 3 -C 8  alkyl carboxylic acid, and wherein such covered fertilizer granulates comprising a crop protection agent are excluded. The copolymerisates are applied to the fertilizer granulate in the form of an aqueous solution or an aqueous dispersion. This way, the use of organic solvents that are potentially harmful for health can be avoided. However, this process has the disadvantage that the water-soluble fertilizer granulate can partially dissolve when the aqueous solution or dispersion of the covering material is applied. For this reason, only a limited amount of the covering material can be added per moiety of time during this process. At the same time, it has to be ensured that the water can evaporate quickly in order to avoid complete dissolution of the granulate. Therefore, this process as well requires a large amount of energy and a technically complex process control in order to remove the water added during the process as quickly as possible.  \\n       [0008] It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a coated granular material and a method for coating granular materials which does not require the use of organic and aqueous solvents, nor low-boiling additives, and wherein no low-boiling by-products are formed which necessitate a complicated cleaning of the exhaust gas and a complex process control. The method should result in a rapid coating of the granular material, wherein the coating should quickly become non-tacky and the covered material should quickly become free-flowing. The coating material should allow as quickly and as uniformly a wetting of the material to be coated as possible and be able to be applied thereto in very thin layers. The method should furthermore allow a trouble-free repetition of the coating process at short intervals.  \\n       [0009] The coating itself should meet different technical requirements: The coverings should be permeable to water or water vapor (in both directions) and allow a controlled and uniform release of the substance dissolved from the granular product to the outside. Furthermore, the covering should not be too brittle but should exhibit a certain elastic strength in order to avoid bursting during storage, application or transport. Preferably, the coating should be biodegradable after the duration of the material&#39;s effect has ended.  \\n       [0010] This object was achieved by the surprising finding that by reacting an acid-modified fatty (acid) component with an epoxide component, a coating material can be provided which meets the requirements listed above. Surprisingly, the coating material of the present invention exhibits the necessary properties even without the addition of organic solvents or water.  \\n       [0011] Thus, the subject-matter of the present invention is a coated granular material wherein the coating comprises the reaction product of (A) an acid-modified fatty (acid) component and (B) an epoxide component.  \\n       [0012] The subject matter of the invention is furthermore a method for preparing a coated granular material comprising the steps (a) providing a granular material, (b) providing a coating material, comprising (A) an acid-modified fatty (acid) component and (B) an epoxide component, (c) adding of the coating material to the provided granular material, (d) generating a coating on the granular material, and (e) optionally repeating steps (c) and (d).  \\n       [0013] The granular material to be coated is not critical. Basically, all granular materials can be coated by means of the present method. The granular material can for example be selected from asymmetrically shaped granular materials (granulates) or symmetrically shaped granular materials (pellets). Typical pellets can for example have the shape of a sphere, a rod, a cylinder or an ellipsoid. Typical granulate particles include asymmetrical aggregates of powder particles, whole crystals, crystal fragments or particles, or other fragments. The granular material can be porous or non-porous.  \\n       [0014] The particle size of the granular materials to be coated is not critical, either. It can for example be 0.5 to 10 mm (longest average diameter), with an average particle size in the range of 1 to 5 mm being preferred.  \\n       [0015] The method is of particular importance for the coating of water-soluble granular materials or such granular materials having a water-soluble portion or being impregnated with a water-soluble substance. Preferred granular materials to be covered are therefore selected from entirely or partially water-soluble granular materials. Examples of such materials include agrochemicals such as fertilizers, crop protection agents, insecticides, fungicides, soil conditioners, drying agents or mixtures thereof.  \\n       [0016] Suitable fertilizers that are suitable for coating are known granulates or pellets of organic and mineral fertilizers as well as mixtures thereof. Mononutrient or multinutrient fertilizers can for example be used which comprise nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium or phosphorus in the form of their salts or oxides alone or in combination. Examples thereof include NP, NK, PK or NKP fertilizers such as lime ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium sulfate nitrate, calcium cyanamide or urea. In addition to the main components mentioned above, the fertilizer granulates can also comprise salts of trace elements such as magnesium, iron, manganese, copper, zinc, molybdenum and/or boron in small amounts, usually in amounts of 0.5 to 5 wt.-%. Suitable organic fertilizers include for example guano, fish meal, bone meal or lignin.  \\n       [0017] According to the present invention, even highly water-soluble or hygroscopic materials can be used as granular material to be coated, e.g. drying agents such as phosphorus pentoxide or calcium chloride. Due to the coating too fast a deliquescence in a humid environment can be prevented.  \\n       [0018] The covering of the granulates according to the present invention comprises the reaction product of an acid-modified fatty (acid) component (A) and an epoxide component (B).  \\n       [0019] The term \\u201cfatty (acid) component\\u201d as used in the present invention comprises both fatty components such as natural and synthetic triglycerides and fatty acid components such as fatty acids and fatty alcohols derivatized at the carboxyl moiety.  \\n       [0020] The term \\u201ccarboxylic acid group\\u201d or \\u201ccarboxylic acid moiety\\u201d as used in the following refers to the carboxyl group of a fatty acid, while the term \\u201cfatty acid group\\u201d or \\u201cfatty acid moiety\\u201d refers to the hydrocarbon group of a fatty acid.  \\n       [0021] The term \\u201cacid-modified\\u201d describes such originally unsaturated compounds into which one or more acid functionalities have been introduced by reacting the unsaturated moieties with unsaturated carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid anhydrides. It is for example known to introduce acid functionality into unsaturated resins by way of a subsequent reaction (e.g. Diels-Alder reaction) with unsaturated carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid anhydrides or by copolymerization with the unsaturated monomer forming the resin.  \\n       [0022] Thus, in the present invention, an acid-modified fatty (acid) component (A) is an adduct obtainable by reacting  \\n       [0023] (A-i) a fatty or fatty acid component which is at least mono-unsaturated in the fatty acid group with  \\n       [0024] (A-ii) an at least mono-unsaturated carboxylic acid component or carboxylic acid anhydride component.  \\n       [0025] Basically, all natural or synthetic triglycerides or esters of other polyvalent alcohols with fatty acids, but also fatty acids or carboxylic acid derivatives of fatty acids or fatty alcohols and their derivatives can be used as fatty (acid) component (A-i), as long as they have at least one double bond in the fatty acid group. The unsaturated fatty (acid) component should comprise at least one double bond, but it can also comprise several. In the present invention, the configuration of the double bond(s) is not essential. The double bond(s) in the fatty acid portion can be of a cis- or a trans-configuration. If the unsaturated fatty acid group has more than one double bond, they can be conjugated or non-conjugated.  \\n       [0026] In order to allow a polymeric cross-linking reaction with the epoxide component (B) later on, the average double bond functionality of the fatty (acid) component (A-i) should be at least 2, preferably 3.0 to 9.0.  \\n       [0027] Such fatty (acid) components (A-i) having a chain length of 3 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 10 to 22 carbon atoms, in the fatty acid portion are preferred.  \\n       [0028] Several different forms of component (A-i) are suitable for preparing the acid-modified fatty (acid) component (A).  \\n       [0029] The fatty acid component (A-i) can for example be provided in the form of natural or synthetic triglycerides.  \\n       [0030] In this connection, the distribution of the double bond(s) in the triglyceride is not essential. For example, triglycerides having only one fatty acid with at least two double bonds wherein the other two fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated are suitable. However, the double bonds can also be distributed in the fatty acid groups.  \\n       [0031] In a preferred embodiment, component (A-i) is provided in the form of natural fats and oils. Suitable substances therefor include for example linseed oil, hempseed oil, rape-seed oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, castor oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, coconut butter, palm kernel oil, train oil, fish oil, lard oil, tall oil, lard, beef suet, cashew nut oil, palm oil or mixtures thereof.  \\n       [0032] Natural oils and fats are present as a mixture of different triglycerides. Accordingly, a natural fat or oil can also contain triglycerides that only have saturated fatty acid groups. This portion per se does not interfere with the reaction with the carboxylic acid moiety to form component (A) nor with the reaction of components (A) and (B) later on. If desired, this portion can be separated. However, in a preferred embodiment, no separation takes place. Preferably, the amount of saturated triglycerides should not exceed 15%, preferably 12%, and more preferably 10%, based on the total amount of triglycerides. Therefore, according to the present invention, such fats and oils are preferred that have as high an amount of unsaturated fatty acids as possible. The amount of unsaturated fatty acids can be determined by means of known methods with the help of the iodine number.  \\n       [0033] In addition to natural and synthetic glycerin fatty acid esters, unsaturated esters of other polyalcohols with fatty acids are also suitable as fatty (acid) component (A-i). Saturated aliphatic alcohols with at least two, preferably two to six, hydroxyl groups per molecule and 2 to 20, preferably 2 to 6, carbon atoms can be used as polyvalent alcohols. Specific examples are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, cyclohexane diol, threitol, erythritol and sorbitol. In these compounds, the hydroxyl groups can be fully or only partially esterified with fatty acids. The fatty acid groups can be the same or different from each other.  \\n       [0034] In another embodiment, the fatty (acid) component (A-i) can be provided in the form of at least mono-unsaturated, preferably di-unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. For this purpose, branched or straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives or mixtures thereof can be used.  \\n       [0035] Fatty acid derivatives usually refer to such compounds wherein the carboxylic acid moiety of the fatty acid has been chemically modified. The carboxylic acid moiety can for example be present as an ester or an amide or be reduced to an alcohol wherein the alcohol function can either be free or present in the form of an ester or ether.  \\n       [0036] Compounds of the general formula  \\n       R\\u2014CO\\u2014OR 1 \\u2003\\u2003(I)  \\n       [0037] can for example be used as fatty acid esters, wherein R is a branched or unbranched hydrocarbon group with 3 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 20 carbon atoms, having at least one, preferably two, double bond(s), and R 1  is a straight-chain or branched alkyl group with 1 to 21, preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms.  \\n       [0038] Compounds of the general formula  \\n       R\\u2014CO\\u2014NR 2 R 3 \\u2003\\u2003(II)  \\n       [0039] can for example be used as fatty acid amides, wherein R is a branched or unbranched hydrocarbon group with 3 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 20 carbon atoms, having at least one, preferably two, double bond(s), and R 2  and R 3  independently represent a hydrogen atom or a branched or unbranched C 1 -C 12 , preferably C 1 -C 6 , alkyl group.  \\n       [0040] Suitable fatty alcohols and fatty alcohol derivatives are for example those of the general formula  \\n       R-O\\u2014R 4 \\u2003\\u2003(III)  \\n       [0041] wherein R is a branched or unbranched hydrocarbon group with 3 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably with 8 to 20 carbon atoms, having at least one, preferably two, double bonds, and R 4  represents a hydrogen atom or a branched or unbranched C 1 -C 12 , preferably C 1 -C 6 , alkyl group or a group \\u2014(CO)R 5 , wherein R 5  is a branched or unbranched C 1 -C 12 , preferably C 1 -C 6 , alkyl group.  \\n       [0042] Ethers of fatty alcohols with polyols, e.g. with glycerol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol or propanediol can also be used as fatty alcohol ethers.  \\n       [0043] Such fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives wherein the group R in formulas (I) to (III) represents a natural, at least mono-unsaturated, preferably di-unsaturated fatty acid group, e.g. a palmitoleic acid group, an oleic acid group, an erucic acid group, a sorbic acid group, a linoleic acid group or a linolenic acid group, are especially preferred.  \\n       [0044] The above-mentioned compounds (A-i) can be used individually or in admixture.  \\n       [0045] Suitable carboxylic acid components (A-ii) are unsaturated carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid anhydrides having at least one double bond. The position of the double bond with respect to the acid or anhydride moiety is not critical. However, especially favorable results are obtained when the double bond is in a conjugated position to the carboxylic acid or anhydride moiety. The carboxylic acid component (A-ii) can be aliphatic, mono-unsaturated, poly-unsaturated or aromatic. A single carboxylic acid component or mixtures of different carboxylic acid components (A-ii) can be used for preparing the acid-modified fatty (acid) component (A).  \\n       [0046] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, carboxylic acid anhydrides of dicarboxylic acids that have at least one, preferably one to three, and especially preferred one double bond and typically comprise at total of 4 to 15, preferably 4 to 8, carbon atoms are used for preparing component (A). Of these carboxylic acid anhydrides, those having at least one double bond in a conjugated position to the anhydride moiety are especially preferred.  \\n       [0047] Suitable unsaturated carboxylic acids are for example maleic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, phthalic acid or fumaric acid.  \\n       [0048] Suitable unsaturated carboxylic acid anhydrides are maleic acid anhydride, itaconic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, naphthaline-1,8-dicarboxylic acid anhydride, nadic acid anhydride or mixtures thereof. It is especially preferred that the carboxylic acid component (A-ii) be selected from maleic acid anhydride, itaconic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride and mixtures thereof.  \\n       [0049] Especially suitable compounds for component (A) are adducts of maleic and/or phthalic acid anhydride and sunflower oil, soybean oil or linseed oil, or mono- or poly-unsaturated fatty acid esters of simple alcohols, preferably C 1 -C 4  alkanols, wherein the fatty acid group has a chain-length of 5 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 10 to 22 carbon atoms.  \\n       [0050] The epoxide component (B) is not particularly restricted. Both compounds with terminal epoxide groups and compounds with internal epoxide groups can be used as epoxide component. Preferably, the epoxide component should have an average epoxide functionality of at least two epoxide groups per molecule in order to allow the formation of a polymeric network. The molecular weight of the epoxide compounds is typically in the range of 200 to 3,000. The epoxide oxygen content is usually between 1 and 20 wt.-%, preferably 5 and 15 wt.-%.  \\n       [0051] Examples of epoxide compounds with terminal epoxide groups are glycidyl ethers obtained from reacting compounds having hydroxyl groups and epichlorohydrin, e.g. epoxide resins on the basis of bisphenol-A or bisphenol-F, reaction products of epichlorohydrin and o-cresol or phenol novolaks, glycidyl ethers of polyols such as 1,6-hexanediol, trimethylolpropane, glycerol or polyglycerol.  \\n       [0052] Furthermore, compounds with terminal or internal epoxide groups obtained by the epoxidation of olefins or other unsaturated compounds with an epoxidation agent, e.g. performic acid, are also suitable. In principle, reaction products of glycidol and epoxides, isocyanates or other compounds are suitable as well.  \\n       [0053] Additional suitable compounds with internal epoxide groups include fats and oils that have been \\u201cepoxidized\\u201d (at unsaturated moieties originally present in the fatty acid group) as well as epoxidized fatty acid derivatives. Suitable fatty acid derivatives include epoxidized esters of fatty acids with mono- or polyvalent alcohols, epoxidized fatty acid amides, and esters or ethers of epoxidized fatty alcohols.  \\n       [0054] Examples of epoxidized fatty acid esters are esters of fatty acids that have been epoxidized (at unsaturated moieties originally present in the fatty acid group) with mono- or polyvalent alcohols. Suitable monovalent alcohols are for example branched or unbranched C 1 -C 6  alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, iso- and n-propanol, iso- and n-butanol. Suitable polyvalent alcohols comprise saturated aliphatic alcohols with at least two, preferably two to six hydroxyl groups per molecule and 2 to 20, preferably 2 to 6, carbon atoms. Specific examples are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, cyclohexanediol, threitol, erythritol and sorbitol.  \\n       [0055] Examples of epoxidized fatty acid amides are amides of epoxidized fatty acids and NH 3  or simple primary or secondary amines and diamines having e.g. 1 to 12, preferably 1 to 6, carbon atoms, such as methyleneamine, dimethyleneamine, methylethylamine, methylenediamine or diethyleneamine.  \\n       [0056] As epoxidized fatty alcohol derivatives, esters of epoxidized fatty alcohols and simple C 1 -C 7 , preferably C 2 -C 7  carboxylic acids can be mentioned, such as acetic acid, butyric acid or benzoic acid, or ethers of epoxidized fatty alcohols with mono- or polyvalent alcohols. Suitable monovalent alcohols are for example branched or unbranched C 1 -C 6 , preferably C 1 -C 4  alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, iso- and n-propanol, iso- and n-butanol. Suitable polyvalent alcohols comprise saturated aliphatic alcohols with at least two, preferably two to six hydroxyl groups per molecule and 2 to 20, preferably 2 to 6, carbon atoms. Specific examples are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, cyclohexanediol, threitol, erythritol and sorbitol.  \\n       [0057] Especially suitable epoxidized fatty acid derivatives have a chain length of 5 to 24, preferably 10 to 22, carbon atoms in the fatty acid portion.  \\n       [0058] Polymeric epoxide compounds such as epoxidized polyoctylene and epoxidized polyisoprene are also suitable as epoxide component (B). Mixtures of different epoxide components can be used as well.  \\n       [0059] Bisphenol-A and bisphenol-F epoxide resins, glycidyl ethers of trimethylolpropane and glycerol, epoxidized soybean, linseed, rape-seed or hempseed oils and mixtures thereof are especially preferred.  \\n       [0060] For preparing the coated granular material, the granular material is first provided and optionally preheated to a temperature of 50 to 250\\u00b0 C., preferably 80 to 150\\u00b0 C., before the coating material is added.  \\n       [0061] The acid-modified fatty (acid) component (A) is mixed with the epoxide component (B) to provide the coating material. If desired, further additives can be added to the coating material, such as catalysts, modifying agents, fillers or other components that are advantageous for the specific application of a certain coated granular material.  \\n       [0062] In the method according to the present invention, the easiest way to carry out the coating process is in a rotating vessel, e.g. a drum that is preferably equipped with an edge scraper.  \\n       [0063] The coating material can be added to the granular material continuously or in portions. The portions added can comprise identical or different amounts of coating material. Preferably, the next portion of coating material should be held back until the portion of coating material added in the previous step has been distributed as uniformly as possible on the granular material. Depending on the temperature, amount and type of the coating material and the granulate used, this time period can for example comprise 2 to 10 minutes. Continuous addition can typically take from 15 to 60 minutes. It is especially preferred to provide the coating material without the addition of solvents or water.  \\n       [0064] The amount of coating material added is not essential. However, from an economic point of view, it is desirable to use as small an amount of coating material as possible. At the same time, however, the amount should be large enough to provide a functioning covering on the granulate. The coating material is usually used in an amount of about 3 to 40 wt.-%, preferably 5 to 15 wt.-%, based on the granular material to be covered. Moreover, the release rate of the substance from the coated granules can be controlled via the amount of coating material.  \\n       [0065] It is preferred to agitate the coated granular material throughout the entire process. This can for example be done by stirring or shaking. However, other application methods for carrying out the process are conceivable as well. For instance, the agitation of the granular material can be carried out by means of a fluidized-bed process. Here, a fluidized bed of the granular material is generated by means of a fluidizing gas and the coating material is subsequently added to the fluidized bed. Such fluidized-bed application processes are for example described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,985.  \\n       [0066] The curing of the coating material can for example be controlled by increasing the temperature or adding catalysts. The process is usually carried out at a temperature of 50 to 250\\u00b0 C., preferably 80 to 150\\u00b0 C. The catalysts typically used in the technical field for the catalysis of reactions between epoxide and acid/anhydride moieties are suitable catalysts. They include nitrogen-containing catalysts such as tertiary amines, imidazoles and their derivatives, polyimidazoles and copolymers of imidazole and suitable comonomers, dicyanamide, quaternary ammonium compounds, boron trifluoride derivatives, as well as calcium or magnesium salts of fatty acids, such as calcium or magnesium stearate.  \\n       [0067] The coating of the granular material can be comprised of more than one layer of the cured coating material (reaction product) and the layers can have the same or different thicknesses and each of them can partially or fully cover the material. However, on the whole, the covering should cover the material as completely as possible in order to prevent too early or too rapid a release of the granular material or the active substance contained in the granular material.  \\n       [0068] The coating is permeable to water or water vapor in both directions. Therefore, the coated granular materials of the present invention are characterized by a uniform release of the active substance. Depending on the thickness and type of the covering material, a fertilizer granulate can for example be produced whose effectiveness can last from one month up to two years. Furthermore, the coating has favorable mechanical properties. Another advantage of the coated granular materials according to the present invention is that the covering material is mainly based on renewable raw materials and is therefore preferable from an ecological point of view.  \\n       [0069] The method is suitable for coating practically every kind of granular material. However, the particular advantages of the method are especially evident in the case of completely or partially water-soluble granular materials. The method can be carried out at relatively low temperatures and in the absence of undesired solvents. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     EXAMPLES  \\n     [0070] The invention is described in the following examples which do not restrict the invention in any way.  \\n     [0071] 1.

The reaction mixture was held at this temperature for 4 hours. A viscous, clear brown product was obtained.  \\n     [0078] 2. Preparation of Coated Granulates  \\n     [0079] The coatings were carried out in a rotating drum. The speed was adjusted such that sufficient mixing of the product to be coated was guaranteed. The granulate was agitated during the entire coating process.  \\n     [0080] A commercially available untreated NPK mineral fertilizer with a grain size of 3 to 6 mm was used for coating. Prior to coating, the fertilizer was preheated in an oven to about 120\\u00b0 C.  \\n     Example 1  \\n     [0081] A mixture of 23.0 wt.-% trimethylol propane triglycidyl ether and 77 wt.-% curing agent 1 was prepared in a beaker. The coating composition, a total of 15 wt.-% based on the fertilizer, was added to the product to be coated in four equal portions whereby the next portion was not added until the previously added portion had cured. The coating period was a total of about 20 to 30 minutes. The still hot covered fertilizer was not tacky, did not stick together and was free-flowing/-running. The curing temperature was 150\\u00b0 C.  \\n     Example 2  \\n     [0082] A mixture of 31.0 wt.-% epoxidized linseed oil and 60 wt.-% curing agent 2 was prepared in a beaker. The coating composition, a total of 10 wt.-% based on the fertilizer, was added to the product to be coated in five equal portions whereby the next portion was not added until the previously added portion had cured. The coating period was a total of about 20 to 30 minutes. The curing temperature was 150\\u00b0 C. The still hot covered fertilizer was not tacky, did not stick together and was free-running.  \\n     Example 3  \\n     [0083] A mixture of 29.0 wt.-% epoxidized linseed oil, 70.5 wt.-% curing agent 3 and 0.5 wt.-% 4-methylimidazole was prepared in a beaker. The coating composition, a total of 10 wt.-% based on the fertilizer, was added to the product to be coated in five equal portions whereby the next portion was not added until the previously added portion had cured. The coating period was a total of about 20 to 30 minutes. The curing temperature was 140\\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0084] The still hot covered fertilizer was not tacky, did not stick together and was free-running.  \\n     Example 4  \\n     [0085] A mixture of 28.0 wt.-% epoxidized linseed oil, 8.0 wt.-% epoxidized trimethylolpropane trioleate, 63.0 wt.-% curing agent 2 and 1.0 wt.-% magnesium stearate was prepared in a beaker.  \\n     [0086] The coating composition, a total of 8.0 wt.-% based on the fertilizer, was continuously added to the product to be coated for a time period of about 15 minutes. Then heat-curing was conducted for 20 minutes. The curing temperature was 160\\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0087] The still hot covered fertilizer was not tacky, did not stick together and was free-running.  \\n     Example 5  \\n     [0088] A mixture of 31.0 wt.-% epoxidized linseed oil and 69 wt.-% curing agent 2 was prepared in a beaker. The coating composition, a total of 8 wt.-% based on the fertilizer, was added to the product to be coated in seven equal portions whereby the next portion was not added until the previously added portion had cured. The coating period was a total of about 60 minutes. The curing temperature was 110\\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0089] The still hot covered fertilizer was not tacky, did not stick together and was free-running.  \\n     [0090] Determination of the Release of Active Substance  \\n     [0091] For determining the release of active substance, 12.5 g each of the coated fertilizers prepared in Examples 1 to 5 were added to 1250 g water and stored at 22\\u00b0 C. The amount of active substance that had dissolved was determined on the basis of the increase in electric conductivity. The amount of active substance that has dissolved can be determined by a comparison with uncoated basic fertilizer.

The power amplifier itself usually has a nonlinear characteristic which is undesirable since it causes the input signal to be distorted, i.e. a gain imparted on said input signal by said power amplifier is not constant but depends on an amplitude of said input signal.  \\n       [0004] To avoid this unwanted distortion, the input signal is predistorted by a predistorter prior to feeding it to said power amplifier. The predistorter distorts or shapes, respectively, the characteristic of the input signal in a manner opposite to the distortion caused by said power amplifier, and in a well-tuned system an overall distortion of said input signal may thus be avoided. Said predistortion is usually achieved by multiplying said input signal by a correction signal or by adding such a correction signal which depends on said input signal.  \\n       [0005] Contemporary methods use so-called polynomial predistorters wherein the correction signal is based on a polynomial. Since each function value of a polynomial depends on all coefficients of said polynomial, it is not possible to tune the correction signal or certain intervals of it, respectively, via changing one or few coefficients without changing the complete correction signal. As a further disadvantage, said polynomial predistorter only works well for a limited range of input amplitudes and is thus not flexible with respect to a varying mean power of said input signal. Furthermore, the polynomial predistorter is not flexible enough with respect to special required shapes of a characteristic of the non-linear power amplifier.  \\n       [0006] Another solution known from prior art employs a lookup table to determine function values of said correction signal. Consequently, it is possible to configure a predistorter wherein each function value depends on one parameter that can be read from said lookup table. This solution also lacks flexibility, because especially in adaptive systems, where a dynamic modification of said parameters is required, the number of parameters that must be updated is too high.  \\n       [0007] The present invention relates to a method of influencing an input signal, in particular an input signal of a power amplifier of a wireless communication system, wherein said input signal has a range of input amplitudes, wherein a correction signal depending on said input signal is generated, and wherein said input signal is influenced depending on said correction signal.  \\n       [0008] The present invention also relates to a predistorter for influencing an input signal, in particular an input signal of a power amplifier of a wireless communication system, wherein said input signal has a range of input amplitudes, wherein a correction signal depending on said input signal is generated, and wherein said input signal is influenced depending on said correction signal.  \\n       [0009] Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of influencing an input signal and a corresponding predistorter which provide increased flexibility.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0010] This object is achieved by a method of influencing an input signal, in particular an input signal of a power amplifier of a wireless communication system, wherein said input signal has a range of input amplitudes, wherein a correction signal depending on said input signal is generated, and wherein said input signal is influenced depending on said correction signal, wherein a generation of said correction signal is based on a plurality of base functions, and in that said range of input amplitudes is divided into intervals, wherein each of said base functions contributes to said correction signal in a limited number of intervals.  \\n       [0011] The object of the invention is further achieved by a predistorter for incluencing an input signal, in particular an input signal of a power amplifier of a wireless communication system, wherein said input signal has a range of input amplitudes, wherein a correction signal depending on said input signal is generated, and wherein said input signal is influenced depending on said correction signal, wherein a generation of said correction signal is based on a plurality of base functions, and wherein said range of input amplitudes is divided into intervals, wherein each of said base functions contributes to said correction signal in a limited number of intervals.  \\n       [0012] According to the present invention, the generation of said correction signal is based on a plurality of base functions, and said range of input amplitudes is divided into intervals, wherein each of said base functions contributes to said correction signal in a limited number of intervals.  \\n       [0013] Hence it is possible to shape a desired characteristic of said correction signal more accurately as compared to the approach using one polynomial for the definition of the whole correction signal, because changing one base function or its coefficients or the like does not affect the whole correction signal but only some portions of the correction signal which correspond to the intervals in which said changed base function contributes to the correction signal.  \\n       [0014] The other portions of said correction signal remain unchanged, because of which the mechanism may also be said to have a \\u201clocal effect\\u201d on said correction signal, and which enables an elaborated adaption of said correction signal.  \\n       [0015] To control the local effect more precisely, a variant of the inventive method is characterized in that a set of base functions contributes to said correction signal only in a corresponding interval and/or in a limited number of neighbour intervals. I.e. changing such a base function will affect the corresponding interval and a limited number of neighbour intervals thus affecting a portion of said correction signal that is larger than one single interval but yet significantly smaller than the whole correction signal. In this case, base functions of neighbour intervals may overlap each other.  \\n       [0016] Contributing to said correction signal in this sense of the present invention means to significantly change the correction signal, regardless of the mode by which said change is performed. I.e. if various base functions are added together, a contribution in the sense of the present invention means that said base functions have non-zero function values large enough to change the resulting sum in a noticeable way.  \\n       [0017] Consequently, a base function may also have non-zero function values and may not contribute to said correction signal in the above sense, as long as said non-zero function values are very small compared to any other function value of the above mentioned sum.  \\n       [0018] According to a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention, said base functions are chosen such that said correction signal and a first and/or higher derivatives of said correction signal are continuous. This enables the correction signal to be modified by changing said base functions or coefficients of said base functions or the like while maintaining a smooth correction signal. Algorithms for changing said base functions must hence not obey any restriction to changing said base functions in order to maintain a smooth correction signal.  \\n       [0019] A further variant of the invention is characterized in that said base functions have non-zero function values within a number of neighbour intervals and function values and/or derivatives of first or higher order of zero at all but one interval bounds of said neighbour intervals, in that either a function value or a derivative of said base functions is different from zero at one interval bound of said neighbour intervals, and in that said base functions are smooth. This guarantees the above explained local effect while at the same time ensuring a smooth correction signal.  \\n       [0020] According to a very advantageous variant of the present invention, a maximum of four different base functions has non-zero function values at a distinct input amplitude, i.e. at a distinct interval of said range of input amplitudes. Hence only said four base functions and their parameters contribute to a function value of the correction signal used for predistorting the input signal thus again achieving said \\u201clocal effect\\u201d.  \\n       [0021] Instead of having non-zero function values, said four different base functions may have rather small function values, either, that do not contribute to said correction signal in said interval significantly, or in case said base functions are multiplied with each other, they may as well have function values of about one in order not to contribute to said correction signal significantly.  \\n       [0022] It is not necessary to restrict the number of base functions to four, every other number of base functions may also be used, as long as the overall number of base functions is e.g. smaller than the number of parameters to be changed with a prior art lookup table.  \\n       [0023] Another variant of the method according to the present invention is characterized in that said correction signal is a weighted sum of said base functions according to  \\n           \\u0393   \\ue8a0     (   x   )       =       \\u2211     i   =   0       N   -   1       \\ue89e     \\u2003     \\ue89e       a   i     \\ue89e       \\u03d5   i     \\ue8a0     (     r   \\ue8a0     (   x   )       )             ,                 \\n \\n       [0024] wherein complex coefficients  \\n       \\u03b1 i   \\u03b5C,i= 0 , . . . ,N\\u2212 1  \\n       [0025] are provided for each base function  \\n       \\u03c6 i   ,i= 0 , . . . ,N\\u2212 1,  \\n       [0026] and wherein  \\n         r=r ( x ), r\\u03b5R    \\n       [0027] is a function of said input signal (x).  \\n       [0028] Since in most cases, especially with digital baseband predistortion for power amplifiers of wireless communication systems, said input signal x is a complex variable, r(x) may e.g. be chosen as an absolute value of said input signal, if the correction signal is desired to only depend on the input signal&#39;s amplitude. The base functions \\u03c6 i ,i=0, . . . ,N\\u22121, in turn, depend on r(x).  \\n       [0029] The coefficients \\u03b1 i \\u03b5C,i=0, . . . ,N\\u22121 are complex numbers and are used as weights which determine to what extent each of the base functions contributes to said correction signal.

Said delay caused by the delay means  10  accounts for a computation time required by the predistorter  100  to calculate the correction signal \\u0393(x) out of the input signal x.  \\n     [0049] The calculation of the correction signal \\u0393(x) is described in the following passages.  \\n     [0050] At first, an absolute value r of said input signal x is obtained by successively calculating the squared absolute value within calculation means  11  and applying a square root function to said squared absolute value within calculation means  12 :  \\n       r ( x )={square root}{square root over (x I   2   +x   Q   2 )},  \\n     [0051] wherein  \\n     [0052] X=x I +jX Q  and x I ,x Q \\u03b5R.  \\n     [0053] In a digital baseband system of a wireless communications system, r(x) corresponds to an amplitude of said input signal x.  \\n     [0054] The square root calculation operation performed within calculation means  12  may be approximated by a polynomial. This is particularly useful if the predistorter  100  is realized on e.g. a digital signal processor (DSP).  \\n     [0055] After obtaining said absolute value r(x), which in the following explanations will be referred to as amplitude r of said input signal, a corresponding interval number is evaluated by interval number evaluation means  14 .  \\n     [0056] This is necessary to determine the correct set of base functions to be used to calculate the portion of the correction signal \\u0393(x) which is associated to the respective amplitude r.  \\n     [0057] As can be seen from FIG. 2, the range (r 0 , . . . ,r M\\u22121 ) of input amplitudes is subdivided into intervals (r 0 ,r 1 ),(r 1 ,r 2 ), . . . ,(r M\\u22122 ,r M\\u22121 ), wherein for each interval corresponding base functions  \\n                 \\u03d5   0     \\ue8a0     (   r   )       =     {               1   -       s   2     \\ue8a0     (     3   -     2   \\ue89e   s       )         ,             r   0     \\u2264   r   &lt;

The predistorter can also be easily implemented.  \\n     [0090] If at a certain point only feedback information for adapting coefficients corresponding to small signal amplitudes are available, an existing approximation of the correction signal via the base functions for large signal amplitudes is not influenced and remains constant until feedback information for improving coefficients corresponding to large signal amplitudes will be available again. The predistorter according to the present invention is therefore not as sensitive to power variations of the input signal as prior art polynomial predistorters.  \\n     [0091] Furthermore, with the various sets of base functions, any desired characteristic of the correction signal can be implemented more easily as compared to a prior art lookup table approach. The proposed method does also enable a faster adaptation as is given with contemporary lookup table solutions.  \\n     [0092] The method according to the present invention and/or the predistorter are not limited to be used with a power amplifier, they may be used with any non-linear device or channel which requires a process of predistortion.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004265979-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The present invention relates to a novel FKA-25 substance, which inhibits formation of the foam macrophage originated from mouse, having inhibitory action against formation of the foam macrophage and a process for production thereof.

More particularly, the present invention pertains the FKA-25 substance (hereinafter sometimes designates as FKA-25) which inhibits specifically formation of the foam macrophage originated from mouse and is useful for prevention and treatment of various diseases such as arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral apoplexy, and production thereof.  \\n       BACKGROUND ART  \\n       [0002] Recently life-style related diseases such as hyperlipidemia and obesity of adults are increased due to changes of the eating habit. Such life-style related diseases have been known to develop atherosclerosis, further to the pathologic state directly connecting to death such as myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral apoplexy (Matsuzawa, Y., Nippon Rinsho, 59, 189-194, 2001). At present, drugs, for example the statin series drug such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin and atorvastatin are used for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. These drugs exhibit reducing effect of blood cholesterol level due to inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, a rate limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo. However, arteriosclerosis is developed by complex mechanisms, and development of drugs having different mechanism of action is further requested.  \\n       [0003] It has been known that in the initial lesion of atherosclerosis, macrophage infiltrated into the arterial endothelium recognizes denatured LDL generated by any degeneration such as oxidation and glucosylation of low density lipoprotein (hereinafter sometimes designates as LDL) flowing in the blood stream, incorporates the denatured LDL indefinitely, and hydrolyses such the denatured LDL to generate free cholesterol and lipid acid, which are converted to cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol and these are accumulated in the cytoplasm as lipid droplets. Then the macrophage is converted to the foam macrophage, as a result, atherosclerosis is progressed (Goldstein, J. L. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76, 333-337, 1979, and Gerrity, R. G., Am. J. Pathol. 103, 181-190, 1981).  \\n       [0004] Consequently, a substance inhibiting macrophage foaming process is expected to suppress directly development of atherosclerotic lesion, however drugs having such effect including, for example, statin series drugs such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin and atorvastatin, have not been known.  \\n       DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0005] In such circumstances, it is expected that providing substance having inhibitory action against formation of the foam macrophage brings about good news to the human health as a new drug for directly acting in atherosclerotic lesion and suppressing its progress.  \\n       [0006] The present invention provides novel FKA-25 substance, which can satisfy such expectation, having inhibitory action against formation of the foam macrophage and production thereof. The present invention further provides drugs for prevention and treatment of arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral apoplexy comprising FKA-25 having inhibitory action against formation of the foam macrophage as an active ingredient and a microorganism producing FKA-25 substance.  \\n       [0007] We have studied for solving such problems and further studied for finding novel substance having inhibitory action against formation of foam macrophage.

The strain was referred to  Pseudobotrytis  sp. FKA-25 and was deposited in International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305-8566 Japan according to Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure on Sep. 27, 2002 and received the deposition No. FERM BP-8199.  \\n       [0036] As for FKA-25 substance producing microorganism strain used in the present invention, the strain  Pseudobotrytis  sp. FKA-25 hereinbefore can be mentioned as a preferable example. However, it is well known that the microorganism is very easily mutated in the general mycological and can not be maintained constant in the mycological properties, and is mutated by natural means or artificial means, for example commonly used ultraviolet irradiation or mutation inducer such as N-methyl-N\\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and ethyl methansulfonate. Consequently, the strains belonging to genus  Pseudobotrytis  and having producing ability of FKA-25 substance represented by the chemical formula hereinbefore, including artificial mutants and natural mutants, can be used all in the present invention.  \\n       [0037] The production of FKA-25 substance of the present invention can be performed at first by culturing FKA-25 substance producing microorganism belonging to genus  Pseudobotrytis . As for nutrient sources preferable for production of FKA-25 substance of the present invention, carbon sources which can be assimilable by microorganism, nitrogen sources which can be digestible, and if necessary nutrient medium containing inorganic salt, vitamin, etc. can be used. Examples of carbon sources are sugars such as glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose, galactose, dextrin and starch, and vegetable oil such as soybean oil. These are used alone or in combination.  \\n       [0038] Examples of nitrogen sources are peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, soybean powder, cotton seed powder, corn steep liquor, malt extract, casein, amino acids, urea, ammonium salts and nitrate. These are used alone or in combination. If necessary, salts such as phosphate, magnesium salt, calcium salt, sodium salt and potassium salt, heavy metal salt such as iron salt, manganese salt, copper salt, cobalt salt and zinc salt, vitamins and substances preferable for FKA-25 substance production can be added.  \\n       [0039] In the culture, when forming occurs, if necessary, antifoaming agent such as liquid paraffin, animal oil, vegetable oil, silicone oil and surface active agent can be added. The culture can be performed by liquid culture or solid culture, if above nutrient sources are contained. In general, the liquid medium is used for the culture. In case of small culture, the culture using flask is preferable.  \\n       [0040] In the large scale production using tank culture, in order to prevent growth delay of the microorganism in the production process, it is preferable that the production strain is at first inoculated and cultured in the relatively small amount of medium, and the cultured mass is transferred into the large tank and is continued to culture. In this case, composition of the medium used in the pre-cultivation and the medium used in the production culture can be same or different.  \\n       [0041] When the culture is performed in aeration with stirring, known method such as stirring by propeller and other mechanical stirring, rotary or shaking the fermenter, pumping or bubbling aeration can be applied. Sterilized air is used for aeration. Culturing temperature can be changed within ranges for production of FKA-25 substance by the FKA-25 substance producing strain, generally at 25-32\\u00b0 C., preferably around at 27\\u00b0 C. Culturing pH is generally 5-8, preferable around 7. Culturing time depends on the culturing condition and is generally about 7 days.  \\n       [0042] FKA-25 substance accumulated in the thus obtained cultured mass is generally found in the cultured mycelia. In order to collect FKA-25 substance from the cultured mycelia, means for collecting metabolites from common microorganism culture can be used alone or in combination, or repeatedly. For example, means such as filtration, centrifugation, dialysis, concentration, drying, freezing, adsorption, desorption, a method for applying solubility difference for various solvents (e.g. precipitation, crystallization, recrystallization, solvent extraction and counter current distribution) and chromatography can be used.  \\n       [0043] FKA-25 substance can be isolated and collected from the mycelial extraction. For example, the substance can be extracted from mycelia using organic solvent such as acetone, ethanol and methanol. After concentration of the extract, extraction using organic solvent such as chloroform and ethyl acetate can be performed. FKA-25 substance can be isolated by silica gel chromatography, Sephadex LH-20, ODS column chromatography, etc. after concentration of the extract.  \\n       [0044] Physico-chemical properties of FKA-25 substance of the present invention are as follows.  \\n       [0045] (1) Nature: White powder  \\n       [0046] (2) Molecular weight: 519 (M+, electron bombardment mass spectroscopy)  \\n       [0047] (3) Molecular formula: C 33 H 45 O 4 N  \\n       [0048] (4) Specific rotation: [\\u03b1] D =\\u221218.0\\u00b0 (c=0.1, in methanol)  \\n       [0049] (5) UV absorption spectrum (in methanol): FIG. 1, maximum absorption at 239 nm and 288 nm  \\n       [0050] (6) IR absorption spectrum (KBr tablet): FIG. 2, specific absorption bands at 3440.4, 3426, 2929, 1693, 1456 and 1378 cm \\u22121    \\n       [0051] (7) Solubility in solvents: Soluble in methanol, acetone, chloroform and ethyl acetate; slightly soluble in water and hexane  \\n       [0052] (8) Color reaction: Positive in sulfuric acid and Dragendorff; negative in ninhydrin  \\n       [0053] (9)  1 H-proton NMR spectrum (in deuterated chloroform) was measured by using XL-400 (Varian Inc.

The extract was concentrated, spotted on TLC plate (silica gel plate, the U.S., Merck Inc., thickness 0.5 mm), and developed with the solvent of hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v).

Field of the Invention  \\n      The present invention relates to a synchronization system and method used for a mobile communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for synchronizing broadcast/multicast service frames provided in a mobile communication system.  \\n      2. Description of the Related Art  \\n      Mobile communication systems were originally designed to provide a voice communication service allowing user mobility. Along with rapid development of the technology, the mobile communication system now provides various services in various fields to meet user demand. The latest mobile communication system can provide not only an SMS service but also email, Internet and broadcast services. To provide the various services, a synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system has evolved to an IS-95 system and then to a CDMA-2000 system, which has been commercialized in some areas. A high-speed data only system, called First Evolution-Data Only (1xEV-DO), was then introduced, and a system enabling high-speed data transmission and voice communication at the same time, which is called First Evolution-Data and Voice (1xEV-DV), was then introduced. Many parts of the 1xEV-DV system are under discussion in the standardization bodies.  \\n      Since the CDMA system basically uses a synchronous mode, it operates within a synchronized network. However, with network synchronization, it is difficult for the mobile communication system to provide broadcast services. This is due to the fact that it has been proposed that the mobile communication system provide broadcast services by interworking with a contents server connected to the system, instead of providing broadcast services using radio waves. Some example systems capable of providing broadcast services are CDMA 2000, CDMA 1xEV-DO, and CDMA 1xEV-DV systems. A conventional network structure and operation for providing broadcast services, for example, using the CDMA 1xEV-DO system will now be described with reference to  FIG. 1 .  \\n       FIG. 1  is an illustrative diagram of the configuration of a CDMA 1xEV-DO system implemented for providing broadcast services. The CDMA 1xEV-DO system includes an Access Terminal (also referred to as a \\u201cmobile terminal\\u201d or a \\u201cmobile station\\u201d) (AT)  100 , and first and second Access Networks (ANs)  110  and  120 , Packet Control Functions (PCFs)  130   a  and  130   b , a Packet Data Service Node (PDSN)  140 , and an authentication system  150  which are implemented to provide high-speed data services to the access terminal  100 . The CDMA 1xEV-DO system further includes a Broadcast/Multicast Service (BCMCS) controller  160  and a BCMCS content server  170  for providing broadcast services. The configuration of the 1x EV-DO mobile communication system for providing high-speed data services to the access terminal will now be described in detail with reference to  FIG. 1 .  \\n      The access network  110  has a specific wireless communication area, and includes Access Network Transceiver Systems (ANTS)  111   a  to  111   n  for providing data services to the access terminal  100  through radio channels established with the access terminal  100 , and an Access Network Controller  112  for controlling the ANTSs  111   a  to  111   n . The access network  120  has a specific wireless communication area, and includes Access Network Transceiver Systems (ANTS)  121   a  to  121   n  for providing data services to the access terminal  100  through radio channels established with the access terminal  100 , and an Access Network Controller  122  for controlling the ANTSs  121   a  to  121   n . The following description will be given based on the access networks  110  and  120  except when their ANTSs and ANCs must be distinguished from each other.  \\n      The PCFs  130   a  and  130   b  are connected respectively to the access networks  110  and  120  to control processing for providing broadcast services and high-speed data services to the access networks  110  and  120 . The PCFs  130   a  and  130   b  are also connected to the PDSN  140 , which is a termination node for connection to the Internet or other networks to provide data services in the mobile communication system. The PDSN  140  is connected to the authentication system  150  for authentication of terminals in the mobile communication system.  \\n      The authentication system  150  includes an Access Network Authentication, Accounting and Authorization (AN-AAA) system  151  for authentication of the 1x EV-DO system, and an AAA system  152  for authentication of other networks such as Internet and broadcast service networks.  \\n      The BCMCS content server  170  is a server for providing broadcast/multicast services to the PDSN  140 . The BCMCS content server  170  produces broadcast data, including video and audio data for broadcasting, into Internet Protocol (IP) packets, and provides the broadcast data IP packets to the PDSN  140 . The BCMCS controller  160  controls the BCMCS content server  170 , and determines whether the broadcast service is to be provided to the terminal, according to the user authentication result.  \\n      The CDMA 1xEV-DO system can provide the broadcast service based on the above configuration as shown in  FIG. 1 . Higher nodes of the access networks  110  and  120  provide the broadcast service to the access networks  110  and  120  in an IP multicast scheme. However, the access terminal  100  may be in motion while receiving the broadcast service. The packet data service is also liable to cause a time delay. To provide the broadcast service to the access terminal  100  properly regardless of whether the access terminal  100  is in motion, BCMCS traffic must be transmitted from the access networks simultaneously to the access terminal  100 . However, packets for providing the broadcast service may be transmitted to the access networks with different time delays. The time delays depend on characteristics of the packets and the amount of BCMCS traffic.  \\n      Since the BCMCS traffic is transmitted using the packets, the access networks may provide packets or frames of the same broadcast service at different times. This problem is critical when performing handoff of the broadcast service. It is also practically impossible for the access terminals to combine and use traffic frames received simultaneously from a number of access networks (also referred to as \\u201cbase stations\\u201d). Further, the access terminal may recognize traffic of the same broadcast service, provided from another base station near the access terminal, as noise.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for synchronizing Broadcast/Multicast Service (BCMCS) content frames of a broadcast/multicast service provided in a mobile communication system.  \\n      It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for enabling an access terminal (or mobile terminal) to receive BCMCS content frames of the same BCMCS service simultaneously from different base stations (or access networks) near the access terminal in a mobile communication system, and then to combine and use the simultaneously received frames.  \\n      It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for increasing the reception efficiency of traffic of a BCMCS service provided in a mobile communication system.  \\n      In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a system and method for transmitting a Broadcast/Multicast Service (BCMCS) content frame in a mobile communication system connected to a BCMCS server. The system and method comprise receiving, by a Packet Data Service Node (PDSN), a BCMCS content frame from the BCMCS server, and transmitting a corresponding Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) packet BCMCS content frame, including a sequence number and a timestamp value indicating when the GRE packet BCMCS content frame is transmitted, from the PDSN to first lower nodes of the PDSN, the first lower nodes being connected downstream of the PDSN; and checking, by each of the first lower nodes, whether the GRE packet BCMCS content frame received from the PDSN is valid, based on the sequence number included in the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame, and, if the GRE packet BCMCS content frame is valid, transmitting the GRE packet BCMCS content frame from each of the first lower nodes to second lower nodes connected downstream of each of the first lower nodes, while synchronizing the transmission of the GRE packet BCMCS content frame, based on the timestamp value included in the GRE packet BCMCS content frame. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      The above and other objects, features and other advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:  \\n       FIG. 1  is an illustrative diagram of the configuration of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) First Evolution-Data Only (1xEV-DO) system implemented for providing Broadcast/Multicast Service (BCMCS) services;  \\n       FIG. 2  is a signal flow diagram illustrating how BCMCS content is provided in a mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 3A  illustrates fields of a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) header changed according to a first embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 3B  illustrates the least significant 16 bits of an A8/A10 GRE header implemented according to the first embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4A  illustrates fields of a GRE header changed according to a second embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4B  illustrates a timestamp header optionally added to the GRE header according to the second embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4C  illustrates another timestamp header optionally added to the GRE header according to the second embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 5  is a control flow chart illustrating how a Packet Control Function (PCF) synchronously transmits GRE packet BCMCS content frames to its lower nodes when receiving the frames from a PDSN according to the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 6  is a flow chart illustrating a synchronization method in a mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 7  is a flow chart illustrating how the PCF handles GRE packet BCMCS content frames sequentially received from the PDSN after receiving a first GRE packet BCMCS content frame therefrom; and  \\n       FIGS. 8 and 9  illustrate an example of a method for synchronously transmitting GRE packet BCMCS content frames received from a higher node according to the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n      Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in different drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted for conciseness.  \\n      A description will be given of solutions to a delay that may occur in forward transmission of BroadcastlMulticast Service (BCMCS) content frames from a Packet Data Service Node (PDSN) to Packet Control Functions (PCFs) and from a PCF to Base Station Systems (BSSs) or Access Networks (ANs) in a mobile communication system providing a BCMCS service. The following description of methods for preventing the delay according to embodiments of the present invention will be divided into two sections, the first for the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) 2000 1x system, and the second for the CDMA First Evolution-Data Only (1x EV-DO) system. Specifically, the first description will be given of methods for synchronizing transmission of BCMCS content frames from a PDSN to PCFs, from a PCF to Base Station Controllers (BSCs), and from a BSC to Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) when the embodiments of the present invention are applied to the CDMA 2000 1x system. The following is a brief description of a method for synchronizing between a PDSN and a PCF in the CDMA 2000 1x system according to the embodiments of the present invention, which will be described in detail later. When the PCF receives a first BCMCS content frame from the PDSN, the PCF reads transmission time information included in the first BCMCS content frame, which indicates the time when the BCMCS content frame is transmitted from the PDSN, and sets a start time for measuring transmission delay on the basis of the read transmission time. Then, when the PCF receives a second BCMCS content frame from the PDSN, the PCF reads transmission time information of the second BCMCS content frame. Based on the two consecutive transmission times, the PCF calculates a transmission period, at intervals of which BCMCS content frames are transmitted from the PDSN. When it is time to receive a third BCMCS content frame, the PCF transmits the first BCMCS content frame, which has been stored in the PCF, to BSCs connected downstream of the PCF. The system and method according to the embodiments of the present invention may be embodied such that the BSC performs the same operation as performed by the PCF for synchronization between the PCF and the BSC. The system may also be embodied such that both the PCF and the BSC (or one of the two) perform the operation for synchronization between the PCF and the BSC. These aspects of the system and method according to the embodiments of the present invention for the CDMA 2000 1x system may also be applied to the CDMA 2000 1x EV-DO system. That is, in the following description, it is assumed that the method according to the embodiments of the present invention are performed in the same manner for both the CDMA 2000 1x system and the CDMA 2000 1x EV-DO system, unless a description is given of a different aspect of the method used for the CDMA 2000 1x EV-DO system from the method used for the CDMA 2000 1x system or of a special aspect unique to the CDMA 2000 1x system.  \\n       FIG. 2  is a signal flow diagram illustrating how BCMCS content is provided in a mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. A method for providing BCMCS content in a mobile communication system according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to  FIG. 2 .  \\n      In  FIG. 2 , base stations or access networks  201 ,  202 ,  203  and  204  are denoted by \\u201cBS\\u201d or \\u201cAN\\u201d (i.e., \\u201cBS/AN\\u201d). This indicates that the present invention is applied to both the CDMA 1x EV-DO system and the CDMA 2000 1x system in the same manner. A first PCF  211 , connected to the first and second base stations  201  and  202 , provides a BCMCS content frame to the first and second base stations  201  and  202  through A8/A9 interfaces. A second PCF  212 , connected to the third and fourth base stations  203  and  204 , provides a BCMCS content frame to the base stations  203  and  204  through A8/A9 interfaces. The first and second PCFs  211  and  212  are connected with a PDSN  221 , which provides a BCMCS content frame to the PCFs  211  and  212  through A10/A11 interfaces. In the mobile communication system configured in this manner, a BCMCS content frame is transmitted from a network device simultaneously to its lower nodes connected downstream of the network device. Specifically, the PDSN  221  transmits the BCMCS content frame simultaneously to the PCFs  211  and  212  connected downstream of the PDSN  221 . The PCFs  211  and  212  transmit the BCMCS content frame simultaneously to the base stations  201 ,  202 ,  203  and  204  connected downstream of the PCFs  211  and  212 . The base stations  201  to  204  transmit the BCMCS content frame simultaneously to the access terminal. The simultaneous transmission to the lower nodes will be described later in more detail. Definitions of the terms used in the embodiments of the present invention will be presented in the following description.  \\n      To enable the PDSN  221  and the PCFs  211  and  212  to transmit the BCMCS content frame simultaneously to their lower nodes, it is necessary to change a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) header defined in the A8/A10 interface.  FIG. 3A  illustrates fields of a GRE header changed according to a first embodiment of the present invention.  \\n      The description of  FIG. 3A  will be given only for changes in a GRE header prescribed in the current specifications. The present invention proposes two main changes in the GRE header.  \\n      The first change is a 1-bit T field added to the GRE header. If the T field is set to \\u201c1\\u201d, it indicates that a 32-bit sequence number in the GRE header is used for time synchronization or that a new 32-bit field for time synchronization, in addition to an existing field corresponding to the sequence number, is added to the GRE header. The T field is used to synchronize BCMCS traffic.  \\n      The second change is a timestamp field added to the GRE header and a changed sequence number field therein. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the conventional 32-bit sequence number in the A8/A10 GRE header for use in unicast transmission is divided into a 16-bit sequence number and a 16-bit timestamp, which are used to compensate for packet loss and transmission delay occurring when BCMCS content frames are transmitted from the PDSN to the PCFs and from the PCFs to the base stations. That is, the currently used 32 bits of a GRE packet are divided into two sections for different uses such that the first 16 bits are used to indicate a sequence number of the GRE packet and the second 16 bits are used to indicate the transmission time of the GRE packet (i.e., indicate when the GRE packet is transmitted).  \\n       FIG. 3B  illustrates the most significant 16 bits of an A8/A10 GRE header implemented according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In  FIG. 3B , the first 2 bits are scaling bits for determining the time unit of the timestamp, and the remaining 14 bits indicate a time value of the timestamp. The remaining 14 bits can express the time with a maximum accuracy of 0.000061035 seconds (i.e., 61.035 micro seconds). The purpose of incorporating the scaling bits into the timestamp of the GRE header is to determine the time unit of the timestamp since the time unit of delay measurement between the PDSN and the PCFs may differ from that between the PCFs and the base stations (specifically, BSCs in the base stations or ANCs in the access networks). The service provider may determine the time unit of the timestamp.  \\n       FIG. 4A  illustrates fields of a GRE header changed according to a second embodiment of the present invention. According to the second embodiment, as shown in  FIG. 4A , a 1-bit \\u201cT\\u201d flag field is added to the conventional A8/A10 GRE header for use in unicast transmission, prescribed in the current specifications, to indicate whether a timestamp is present in the GRE header. In addition, a 32-bit timestamp is optionally added to the GRE header to compensate for transmission delay occurring when BCMCS content frames are transmitted from the PDSN to the PCFs and from the PCFs to the base stations (specifically, BSCs in the base stations or ANCs in the access networks).  \\n       FIG. 4B  illustrates a timestamp header optionally added to the GRE header according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The first 2 bits are scaling bits for determining the time unit of the timestamp, and the remaining 30 bits are used to accurately indicate a time value of the timestamp.  \\n       FIG. 4C  illustrates another timestamp header optionally added to the GRE header according to the second embodiment of the present invention. In  FIG. 4C , the timestamp header uses the low order 32 bits of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) timestamp, without using the scaling bits as in  FIG. 4B . In the following description, a BCMCS content frame including BCMCS content data, with a GRE header added thereto, is referred to as a \\u201cGRE packet BCMCS content frame\\u201d.  \\n       FIG. 5  is a control flow chart illustrating how a PCF synchronously transmits GRE packet BCMCS content frames to BSCs or ANCs when receiving the frames from a PDSN according to an embodiment of the present invention. Although the description of  FIG. 5  is given only for the operation for transmitting GRE packet BCMCS content frames from the PCF to the base station controllers, the method of  FIG. 5  can be performed in the same manner also when a BSC or ANC transmits GRE packet BCMCS content frames, received from the PCF, to BTSs or ANTSs.  \\n      First, the PCF is in a standby mode at step  500 . The standby mode refers to a state in which the PCF waits for the reception of a GRE packet BCMCS content frame. Then, at step  502 , the PCF determines whether a GRE packet BCMCS content frame is received. If a GRE packet BCMCS content frame is received, the PCF proceeds to step  504 . At step  504 , the PCF stores the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame in a buffer. At step  504 , the PCF also checks when the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is transmitted from the PDSN, with reference to a GRE header included in the received frame as shown in  FIGS. 3A and 3B  or  FIGS. 4A  to  4 C, and then determines when to transmit the received frame to its lower nodes. The PCF also confirms a sequence number of the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame, with reference to the GRE header. The PCF then proceeds to step  506  to determine whether the sequence number of the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is subsequent to that of the previously received frame.  \\n      If the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame has the subsequent sequence number, the PCF proceeds to step  510 , otherwise it proceeds to step  508 . At step  508 , the PCF determines whether the currently received frame is the first frame of a corresponding GRE packet BCMCS content traffic. If the currently received frame is the first frame, the PCF returns to step  500 , otherwise it proceeds to step  512 . If the PCF receives a frame previous to a frame which the PCF has transmitted, instead of receiving a frame subsequent to the previously received frame, the received frame is generally discarded.  \\n      This is because there is no need to retransmit the received frame when it is the previous frame. In addition, if the received frame is not the subsequent frame, i.e., if it has no subsequent sequence number, a frame is highly likely to be lost in the transmission line. It is requested that the lost frame be retransmitted, or it is discarded without the retransmission.  \\n      At step  510 , the PCF calculates a transmission period, at intervals of which frames are transmitted from the PDSN, and calculates a delay of the frame transmission from the PDSN. The PCF then proceeds to step  512  to determine whether the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is valid. If the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is valid (i.e., if its transmission delay is within an allowed delay range), the PCF proceeds to step  514  to transmit the broadcast traffic (i.e., the GRE packet BCMCS content frame) according to a predetermined time length (more specifically, after waiting the predetermined time length). If the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is invalid (i.e., if its transmission delay is not within the allowed delay range), the PCF proceeds to step  516  to discard the received data (i.e., the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame).  \\n      The synchronization procedure in the method of  FIG. 5  will now be described with reference to  FIG. 6 .  FIG. 6  is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary synchronization method in a mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The following description of  FIG. 6  will be given for the case where the PCF receives first to third GRE packet BCMCS content frames of a broadcast/multicast service.  \\n      After GRE packet setting is performed for BCMCS content frame transmission, the PCF receives the first GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN at step  600 . The PCF stores the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame in a buffer of size N at step  600 . At step  602 , the PCF reads timestamp information (\\u201c12 ms\\u201d in the example of  FIG. 6 ) in a GRE header of the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame, so as to confirm when the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is transmitted from the PDSN. At step  602 , the PCF also determines a sequence number (SQN=\\u201c1\\u201d in the example of  FIG. 6 ) of the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame. Then, at step  608 , the PCF measures delay (\\u201c12.1 ms\\u221212 ms=0.1 ms\\u201d in the example of  FIG. 6 ) of transmission of the GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN to the PCF. Then, the PCF waits for a second GRE packet BCMCS content frame corresponding to a sequence number \\u201c2\\u201d increased by one from the sequence number \\u201c1\\u201d of the frame received at step  602 .  \\n      At step  604 , after receiving the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame (SQN=2), the PCF reads timestamp information \\u201c24 ms\\u201d in a GRE header of the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame, and calculates a transmission period T (\\u201c24 ms\\u221212 ms=12 ms\\u201d in the example of  FIG. 6 ), at intervals of which GRE packet BCMCS content frames are transmitted from the PDSN. Then, the PCF waits for a third GRE packet BCMCS content frame corresponding to a sequence number \\u201c3\\u201d increased by one from the sequence number \\u201c2\\u201d of the frame received at step  604 .  \\n      Then, at step  608 , the PCF measures delay (\\u201c24.1 ms\\u221224 ms=0.1 ms\\u201d in the example of  FIG. 6 ) of transmission of the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN to the PCF. If the calculated transmission delay is equal to that of the previous frame (i.e., the first frame), it is determined that there is no problem on the transmission line. Even when the calculated transmission delay differs from that of the previous frame (i.e., the first frame), it is determined that there is no problem on the transmission line if the calculated transmission delay is smaller than twice the transmission period.  \\n      Then, at step  610 , the PCF transmits the first GRE packet BCMCS content frame, received from the PDSN, simultaneously to all the BSCs connected to the PCF at a time of \\u201c36 ms\\u201d (=24 ms+12 ms) corresponding to the sum of the time \\u201c24 ms\\u201d when the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame is transmitted from the PDSN and the transmission period \\u201c12 ms\\u201d, measured using the two GRE packet BCMCS content frames received at steps  602  and  604 . The PCF then prepares to transmit the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame, received from the PDSN, simultaneously to all the BSCs connected to the PCF at a time of \\u201c48 ms\\u201d (=24 ms+2\\u00d712 ms) corresponding to the sum of the second frame transmission time \\u201c24 ms\\u201d and twice the transmission period \\u201c24 ms\\u201d (=2\\u00d712 ms).  \\n      On the other hand, after receiving the third GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN at step  606 , the PCF measures, at step  608 , delay (\\u201c36.7 ms\\u221236 ms=0.7 ms\\u201d in the example of  FIG. 6 ) of transmission of the third GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN to the PCF. Even when the calculated transmission delay differs from that of the previous frame, it is determined that there is no problem on the transmission line if the calculated transmission delay is smaller than twice the transmission period. However, if the calculated transmission delay is larger than twice the transmission period, it is determined that there is a problem on the transmission line, and the frame (i.e., the third frame) received too late is discarded.  \\n       FIG. 7  is a flow chart illustrating how the PCF operates when a frame loss occurs when receiving GRE packet BCMCS content frames sequentially after receiving the first GRE packet BCMCS content frame.  \\n      When the PCF receives a GRE packet BCMCS content frame at step  700 , the PCF proceeds to step  702 . At step  702 , the PCF stores the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame in a buffer of size N. At step  702 , the PCF reads timestamp information \\u201c12 ms\\u201d in a GRE header included in the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame, so as to confirm when the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is transmitted from the PDSN. At step  702 , the PCF also determines a sequence number \\u201cSQN=1\\u201d of the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame. Then, at step  710 , the PCF measures delay \\u201c12.1 ms\\u221212 ms=0.1 ms\\u201d of transmission of the GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN to the PCF. Then, the PCF waits for a second GRE packet BCMCS content frame corresponding to a sequence number \\u201c2\\u201d increased by one from the sequence number \\u201c1\\u201d of the frame received at step  702 .  \\n      Then, at step  704 , the PCF receives a second GRE packet BCMCS content frame having a sequence number \\u201c10\\u201d. Since the sequence number of the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame is \\u201c10\\u201d, the second frame is not a frame transmitted subsequent to the previously received frame (i.e., the first frame) having the sequence number \\u201c1\\u201d, so that it is determined that some intermediate frames are lost. Accordingly, the first GRE packet BCMCS content frame is discarded at step  714 .  \\n      The PCF returns to step  700  to receive a GRE packet BCMCS content frame, and then proceeds to step  704  to again perform time synchronization based on the currently received GRE packet BCMCS content frame (i.e., the second received frame) since the first received BCMCS content frame is discarded. The PCF regards the currently received GRE packet BCMCS content frame as a first GRE packet BCMCS content frame required for time synchronization, and stores it in the buffer of size N. At step  704 , the PCF reads timestamp information \\u201c120 ms\\u201d in a GRE header of the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame, so as to confirm when the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame is transmitted from the PDSN. At step  704 , the PCF also determines a sequence number \\u201cSQN=10\\u201d of the received GRE packet BCMCS content frame. Then, at step  710 , the PCF measures delay \\u201c120.3 ms\\u2212120 ms=0.3 ms\\u201d of transmission of the GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN to the PCF. Then, the PCF waits for a second GRE packet BCMCS content frame corresponding to a sequence number \\u201c11\\u201d increased by one from the sequence number \\u201c10\\u201d of the first frame received at step  704 .  \\n      At step  706 , after receiving the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame (SQN=11), the PCF reads timestamp information \\u201c136 ms\\u201d in a GRE header of the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame, and calculates a transmission period T \\u201c136 ms\\u2212120 ms=16 ms\\u201d, at intervals of which GRE packet BCMCS content frames are transmitted from the PDSN. Then, the PCF waits for a third GRE packet BCMCS content frame corresponding to a sequence number \\u201c12\\u201d increased by one from the sequence number \\u201c11\\u201d of the second frame received at step  706 .  \\n      Then, at step  710 , the PCF measures delay \\u201c136.7 ms\\u2212136 ms=0.7 ms\\u201d of transmission of the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN to the PCF. If the calculated transmission delay is equal to that of the previous frame (i.e., the first frame), it is determined that there is no problem on the transmission line. Even when the calculated transmission delay differs from that of the previous frame (i.e., the first frame), it is determined that there is no problem on the transmission line if the calculated transmission delay is smaller than twice the transmission period.  \\n      Then, at step  712 , the PCF transmits the first GRE packet BCMCS content frame received at step  704  simultaneously to all the BSCs connected to the PCF at a time of \\u201c152 ms\\u201d (=136 ms+16 ms) corresponding to the sum of the time \\u201c136 ms\\u201d when the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame is transmitted from the PDSN and the transmission period \\u201c16 ms\\u201d, measured using the two GRE packet BCMCS content frames received at steps  704  and  706 . The PCF then prepares to transmit the second GRE packet BCMCS content frame received at step  706  simultaneously to all the BSCs connected to the PCF at a time of \\u201c168 ms\\u201d (=136 ms+2\\u00d716 ms) corresponding to the sum of the second frame transmission time \\u201c136 ms\\u201d and twice the transmission period \\u201c32 ms\\u201d (=2\\u00d716 ms).  \\n      On the other hand, after receiving a third GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN at step  708 , the PCF measures, at step  710 , delay \\u201c152.7 ms\\u2212152 ms=0.7 ms\\u201d of transmission of the third GRE packet BCMCS content frame from the PDSN to the PCF. Even when the calculated transmission delay differs from that of the previous frame, it is determined that there is no problem on the transmission line if the calculated transmission delay is smaller than twice the transmission period. However, if the calculated transmission delay is larger than twice the transmission period, it is determined that there is a problem on the transmission line, and the frame (i.e., the third frame) received too late is discarded.  \\n      A description of synchronization between the PCF and the BSCs is omitted herein because the same method as described above and the corresponding algorithm can be applied to the synchronization between the PCF and the BSCs.  \\n       FIG. 8  is a diagram illustrating how a receiving side (for example, a PCF) sequentially stores frames (also referred to as \\u201cpackets\\u201d) received from a transmitting side (for example, a PDSN) in a synchronization buffer of the receiving side. First, the receiving side stores a first frame \\u201cSEQ 1\\u201d received from the transmitting side in the buffer at an absolute time T 1 . After calculating a transmission period, at intervals of which frames are transmitted from the transmitting side, the receiving side transmits the first frame \\u201cSEQ 1\\u201d stored in the buffer to it lower nodes (for example, BSCs) at a time when the receiving side receives a third frame \\u201cSEQ 3\\u201d.  \\n       FIG. 9  is a diagram illustrating how the receiving side stores frames received from the transmitting side in the buffer and transmits the stored frames in the case where some frames transmitted from the transmitting side are lost or received by the receiving side much later than a scheduled time. As shown in  FIG. 9 , the receiving side receives a third frame \\u201cSEQ 3\\u201d with a delay longer than the delays of the first and second frames \\u201cSEQ 1\\u201d and \\u201cSEQ 2\\u201d. However, the receiving side receives the third frame \\u201cSEQ 3\\u201d at a time when a fourth frame \\u201cSEQ 4\\u201d is transmitted from the transmitting side. That is, the receiving side receives the third frame \\u201cSEQ 3\\u201d with a delay smaller than twice the transmission period, so that the receiving side stores the third frame \\u201cSEQ 3\\u201d in the buffer and then transmits the third frame to its lower nodes (for example, BSCs) at a time when the fifth frame \\u201cSEQ 5\\u201d is transmitted from the transmitting side. However, the receiving side receives the fourth frame \\u201cSEQ 4\\u201d with a delay larger than twice the transmission period, so that the receiving side cannot transmit the fourth frame to its lower nodes (for example, BSCs) at a time when a sixth frame \\u201cSEQ 6\\u201d is transmitted from the transmitting side. Thus, the fourth frame \\u201cSEQ 4\\u201d is discarded, i.e., it is removed from the buffer. Since the receiving side does not receive the fifth frame \\u201cSEQ 5\\u201d, the receiving side does not transmit the fifth frame to its lower nodes (for example, BSCs).  \\n      As apparent from the above description, the embodiments of the present invention provide a synchronization method in a mobile communication system, which make it possible to efficiently synchronize BCMCS content frames provided in the mobile communication system.  \\n      Although certain embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005097506-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A computer program product including program code, when executed on a computer, tracks the time spent by a user working with the computer for different projects.

These prior art systems require interaction tools which enable the user to identify beginnings and endings of project or work-related time periods, as well as project identification data. For example, the documents DE 44 43 850 A1 and DE 195 16 975 A1 disclose systems for recording project-related information including a portable device with a keyboard, which enables the user to enter project-related data and to indicate the beginnings and endings of project-related or work-related time periods. The information entered by the user is stored in the portable device for later transmission to a computer system in which the collected data are analyzed. Similar known time recording systems are directly implemented on computer systems without making use of portable devices.  \\n      In the current personal-computer technology, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are used to facilitate the interaction between a user and a computer. Prevailing operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows\\u00ae, Unix\\u00ae, Linux\\u00ae and MacOS\\u00ae, have graphical user interfaces which provide a virtual desktop (sometimes simply called \\u201cdesktop\\u201d) to the user. The user can place virtual objects, e.g. windows, link icons and tool bars, on this desktop. Open tasks (or applications) may be displayed by application windows, or, in a \\u201cminimized\\u201d form, by application icons which may appear in a \\u201ctask bar\\u201d on the desktop. Some of the known operating systems, (such as Unix/Linux with GUIs, such as KDE, GNOME, CDE) are able to handle a plurality of desktops at the same time and enable the user to select one of the virtual desktops to be displayed on the screen. Microsoft Windows NT offers multi-desktop capabilities as an optional feature called MultiDesk within the \\u201cWindows NT Resource Kit\\u201d. The user is able to activate different tasks on different desktops thereby enlarging the effective screen space for displaying the application windows. It is also possible to group related tasks into different desktops, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,564,002.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The invention is directed to a computer program product including program code, when executed on a computer, for tracking the time spent by a user working with the computer for different projects.

Before proceeding further with the description of  FIG. 1 , however, a few items of the embodiments will be discussed.  \\n      In some of the embodiments the time spent by a user working with a computer for different projects is tracked. In these embodiments, a plurality of virtual desktops is provided which are assignable to different projects and switchable by the user. By tracking the time spent by the user working on the different desktops, a record can be created of the time spent on each of the projects to which the individual desktops are assigned. The term \\u201cproject\\u201d is herein used as a very general term referring to related items of work, not limited to the term&#39;s meaning in the classic business jargon. For example, besides its classical meaning, it may include different job functions of a user, jobs related to different departments or work groups in the users company, jobs for different clients, etc. In the general meaning used here, a project may, of course, combine work for several \\u201cprojects\\u201d in the classical meaning, or work for one \\u201cproject\\u201d in the classical meaning may be separated into several projects.  \\n      The computer has a graphical user interface (GUI) with a plurality of virtual desktops switchable by the user. The virtual desktops, including the desktop-switching functionality, are controlled by a desktop manager. The switching from one desktop to another forms a \\u201cswitch event\\u201d. The virtual desktops present link icons. In some of the embodiments the desktop manager enables the user to define the link icons individually for the virtual desktops, so that, upon switching from one of the desktops to another, different link icons are displayable. Some of these embodiments with individually definable link icons are equipped with the above-mentioned project-time-tracking functionality associated with the different desktops, others have no project-time-tracking functionality. Similarly, some of the embodiments with project-time-tracking functionality have no individually definable link icons (i.e. the link icons are the same in all the desktops).  \\n      The GUI enables the computer user to interact with the computer. The graphical interface presented to the user is the \\u201cvirtual desktop\\u201d, in analogy to an (actual) desktop on which work is carried out. Elements displayed on a virtual desktop include link icons, control panels, pop-up and pull-down menus, a pointing-device-controlled cursor (e.g. a mouse or track-ball cursor), task bars, and application windows. These desktop elements can be individually placed on a desktop background. Generally, the user is able to define and change their position, appearance and status, as well as the appearance of the desktop background. Link icons represent links to, for example, programs, data files, hardware devices, file folders, Internet resources (URLs, Web-pages). Clicking on a link icon with the pointing device enables the user to quickly access the linked resource, e.g. starting the represented program or opening the represented data file. Control panels and menus, for example, enable the user to control or configure system resources or programs. Application windows represent an interface between running applications (tasks) and the user. A task bar indicates the presently running programs (tasks), for example by means of task icons. Application windows can be \\u201cminimized\\u201d, a task with a minimized application window, for example, is only indicated by its task icon in the task bar. Of course, the above enumeration of desktop elements is not complete; rather, there may be further desktop elements enabling the user to interact with different resources in various manners. A data representation of the particular desktop configuration chosen by the user (i.e. a definition of the different desktop elements displayed and their appearance and position, a desktop background etc.) is permanently stored in the computer so that the configuration is maintained when the user logs out, and is restored at the next log-in. In multi-user systems, each user can have a personal configuration, and all user-individual desktop configurations are stored. When a user logs in, his or her personal configuration is restored.  \\n      As mentioned above, in some of the embodiments, the virtual desktops are provided by a piece of software called \\u201cdesktop manager\\u201d. A desktop manager is, in some of the embodiments, a part of a computer&#39;s operating system kernel, i.e. is running in kernel mode (such as the GUI in Microsoft Windows NT 2000), in other embodiments it is a \\u201cstandard utility program\\u201d running in user mode (such as the GUIs in Linux). In order to display the desktop elements (link icons, mouse cursor, application windows, task bar etc.) and to bestow the required functionality on them, the desktop manager interacts with other parts or components of the operating system. For example, it interacts with a window-management system responsible for the display, management and control of application windows. In some embodiments the desktop manager is a software component separated from other software components, in other embodiments it is combined with other software items, such as the window-management system. The term \\u201cdesktop manager\\u201d is hence a functional term, which does not necessarily imply that a separate software component, solely devoted to desktop management, is provided.  \\n      In the embodiments, not only one, but several virtual desktops are available to the user. Typically, only one of these desktops is displayed (hereinafter: the \\u201cactive desktop\\u201d), whereas the other desktops are either not displayed, or are only displayed in a space-saving representation, e.g. in the form of a desktop symbol within a desktop-symbol bar. When required, the user can switch from the currently active desktop to another desktop, thereby making this other desktop visible and disposing of the previously active desktop. The time during which a certain desktop is active (e.g. the time between two switches) is also referred to in this patent as a \\u201cdesktop session\\u201d. The desktop manager is able to handle a plurality of different virtual desktops. In some of the embodiments, switching between desktops may be performed by the user actuating predefined keys or key combinations (\\u201cshort cuts\\u201d), e.g. [Ctrl]+[F1] (wherein \\u201cF1\\u201d may indicate that a desktop No. 1 is selected) and/or by clicking on the desktop symbol representing the desktop desired. In some of the embodiments, the switching functionality, including the display of the desktop symbols, is assisted by an element of software called a \\u201cpager\\u201d, which is a part of the desktop manager (although in some of the embodiments with modular software design, a pager may be a separable software component).  \\n      As mentioned at the outset, in the prior art plural desktops are used to enlarge the effective screen space for displaying the application windows of the currently active tasks. In such known multi-desktop systems, the users typically group functionally related tasks in the different desktops, for example Web-browser application windows are located in a first desktop, e-mail related application windows in a second one, word-processor-related application windows in a third one, and system-monitoring application windows in a fourth one, etc.  \\n      In the embodiments with project-time-tracking functionality, the plural desktops do not only serve to enlarge the effective stream space, but they are also associated with different projects the user works for. Thereby, by working on a particular desktop, the user indicates that he or she is currently working for a particular project, i.e. the project with which the active desktop is associated. Typically, the user is aware of the meaning of the different projects, but from the computers \\u201cview\\u201d a project is a (meaningless) entity, e.g. identified by a project identifier (or descriptor) which enables it to be distinguished from other projects. For example, a software engineer responsible for developing a new program and maintaining an old program might define two projects, project No. 1 being the project \\u201cdevelopment\\u201d, and project No. 2 the project \\u201cmaintenance\\u201d. He or she might associate desktop No. 1 with project No. 1 and desktop No. 2 with project No. 2, and choose desktop No. 1 when s/he works on project No 1, and desktop No. 2 when s/he works on project No. 2. The computer is arranged to individually track the times spent by the user working on the different desktops. Due to the association between desktops and projects, the times spent on the different projects are thereby individually tracked.  \\n      There may be a one-to-one (1:1) relationship between desktops and projects which means that one desktop is associated with each of the projects. Alternatively, there may be a many-to-one (N:1) relationship between desktops and projects, which means that more than one desktop may be associated with a project. For example, if a project can be subdivided into sub-projects, one desktop may be associated with each of the sub-projects. Hence, in N:1 relationships, the time spent with a certain desktop, the \\u201cdesktop time\\u201d, need not necessarily be the \\u201cproject-time\\u201d of the project the desktop is associated with, since other desktops may also contribute to the project time. Therefore, a distinction is sometimes made in this patent between desktop time and project time, for example in the detailed description of embodiments with an N:1 relationship between desktops and projects. On the other hand, in more general contexts in this patent, the term \\u201cproject-time\\u201d is also used with a more generic meaning also covering \\u201cdesktop time\\u201d.  \\n      In the embodiments, the recording of the time spent by the user working on the different projects is based on \\u201cstart\\u201d and \\u201cstop\\u201d events indicative of a commencement or cessation of work. In the simplest manner of project-time recording, the start event is the switch to the desktop assigned to the respective project from another desktop, or the start of the computer (or the user log-in). The stop event may be defined in the same way by the switch from the current desktop to another desktop, or by the shut-down of the computer (or the user log-out). The recorded project times are then simply the time intervals during which the different project-assigned desktops have been active. However, depending on the kind of project-work, such a definition of the start and stop events might result in an insufficiently accurate time measurement. For example, if a user leaves his or her work place, but leaves the computer running, the time of his or her absence is counted as time spent on the project to which the currently active desktop is assigned. Therefore, in other embodiments a start event is defined by the user manually operating a control element indicative of a start of work, or by the user exhibiting user activity on the computer for the first time after the switch or a stop (e.g. by pressing any key on the keyboard, moving the cursor, making a voice input, etc.). Likewise, a stop event can be defined by the user manually operating a control element indicative of a stop of work, or by a failure to exhibit any user activity on the computer for a specified inactivity time (which may, for example, be a predetermined time ranging from some minutes to one hour, depending on the kind of work). In other embodiments, the user is required to regularly confirm that s/he is still working, e.g. by regularly pressing a \\u201cdead-man&#39;s button\\u201d (which may be represented on the computer by a certain key or combination of keys or a clickable graphical button). Not operating the dead-man&#39;s button for more than an accepted dead time (e.g. one minute) is a stop event. Since stop events may occur during a desktop session (or the time recording may not be started when a switch to the desktop is performed), the \\u201cdesktop time\\u201d may of course, be shorter than the \\u201cdesktop session time\\u201d (i.e. the time during which the desktop was active).  \\n      There are different ways to actually determine the total time spent on the different projects between the start and stop events. In some of the embodiments, the start and stop events are logged (e.g. the nature of an event and its time of occurrence are recorded) for each project-assigned desktop. To obtain project-time statistics, the total time between the start and stop events is calculated for each project, based on the logged data. In other embodiments, the total time elapsed between the start and stop events is individually cumulated for each project-assigned desktop. In the latter embodiments, it is sufficient to store only one number for each desktop, indicating the time already elapsed for the different desktops. For example, if a user generates a start and a stop event in a certain desktop, the time between these events is determined and added to the previously stored cumulated time, which is then replaced by the sum representing the new cumulated time for this desktop. In both embodiments, the logged data representing the start and stop events or the cumulated times are persistently stored, for example in a database or file in the user&#39;s computer, or in a centralized database or file accessible via a network to which the users computer is connected.  \\n      In some of the embodiments, project-time related statistics data (e.g. the times spent on the different projects) are prepared and/or output at predetermined time intervals, for example daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. In other embodiments, project-time-related statistics data are prepared and/or output on user demand, for example by the user clicking on a project-time-statistics icon. In both cases, a project-time-statistics tool is invoked which aggregates the project-time data (e.g. calculates the project times spent from logged event data) and exports the desired statistics data into files of a desired format or into a database. Formats of files can be spreadsheets, raw structured text (with defined delimiters, such as tabs), HTML reports (by using predefined project-statistics templates), etc. The project-time-statistics tool also enables the user to define whether to continue with the existing project-time data (a report to be prepared is then an intermediate report) or to reset the project-time data (in order to start with a new project or a projects new step). A reset may be individually made for the different projects.  \\n      In some of the embodiments, the user is able to configure the multi-desktop-and-project-time-tracking system by means of a configuration tool. For example, the configuration tool enables the user to define the association of one or more desktops to a particular project; (normally project-related) desktop names; the time-tracking type (e.g. logging individual start and stop events or storing cumulated project-ime data); the way in which start and stop events are generated; the way and format in which project-time statistics data are to be generated and presented (e.g. regularly and/or on a user request), as well as additional attributes, for example priority data, etc.  \\n      As already mentioned above, in some of the embodiments the user is able to define, as individual desktop settings, the link icons individually for the virtual desktops. Hence, upon switching from one of the desktops to another, different link icons are displayable. In some of these embodiments, in addition to the link icons, the user is also able to determine further desktop settings individually for the virtual desktops. These further desktop settings are, for example, resources (such as assigned hardware devices), positions of the link icons within the desktop, shortcuts, background pictures etc. Hence, upon switching from one of the desktops to another, different further desktop settings become active.  \\n      In these embodiments, the user can therefore not only assign the different desktops to different projects to track the time spent on them, but also individually adapt the desktops to the different projects. For example, typically each project requires different applications, data files, web sites, resources, short-cuts, etc. By virtue of the ability to define link icons (and, optionally, further desktop settings), the user may specifically define for each desktop those link icons (and further desktop settings) which pertain to the project to which the respective desktop is assigned, thereby creating a project-time-tracking system based on project-specific desktops (however, as mentioned above, it should be noted that in some embodiments the functionality of individually definable link icons (and further desktop settings) is realized without project-time-tracking functionality, in other embodiments the two functionalities are combined).  \\n      In embodiments with individually definable link icons, upon a switch from one virtual desktop to another, the desktop settings of the old desktop (i.e. the desktop active up to the switch) are stored, the desktop settings of the newly selected desktop (also called \\u201cthe new desktop\\u201d) are retrieved, and the retrieved desktop settings are used as the desktop settings for the new desktop.  \\n      The way this is implemented in practice may depend on the operating system used in the computer (it is noted that the term \\u201coperating system\\u201d is often used in a strict sense meaning that portion of the software that runs in kernel mode (see, for example, A. Tanenbaum: Modern Operating Systems, 2 nd  edition, 2001, pp. 1-3)). Herein, the term \\u201coperating system\\u201d is used in a broader sense including software that is typically sold together as \\u201coperating system\\u201d; it hence includes software, such as a graphical user interface, which may run not in kernel mode, but rather in user mode.  \\n      In current Microsoft Windows (MS) operating systems (e.g. Windows 95/98 or NT 2000) the information about desktop elements is stored in two different locations: data representing what desktop elements are to be placed on the desktop is stored in a desktop directory, and data representing where each element is to be placed is stored in the registry. Current MS Windows operating systems provide only one virtual desktop. The embodiments which are extensions to those single-desktop operating systems therefore extend the single-desktop manager&#39;s functionality to a multi-desktop functionality which enables the user to switch between several desktops having individual desktop settings. Upon receipt of a switch event, the desktop settings of the old desktop are exported from the desktop directory and the registry and are stored at another place, e.g. an individual-desktop-settings database, and the desktop settings of the new desktop are imported therefrom into the desktop dirertory and the registry. Application windows of tasks associated with the old desktop are minimized, and may even be removed from the task bar, and application windows of tasks associated with the new desktop are resized (or maximized) and displayed in the task bar. Thereby, tasks associated with non-active desktops keep on running in the background, and their application windows are only minimized and resized. Based on the switch events, and, optionally, on other start and stop events, the multi-desktop-and-project-Ume-tracking extension also implements the project-time-tracking functionality, as described above.  \\n      Other embodiments are extensions to operating systems having desktop maragers able to switch between several desktops \\u201cout of the box\\u201d, such as Unix or Unix derivate operating systems, including Linux (called \\u201cUnix/Linux\\u201d hereinafter). Such desktop managers, for example, are KDE, GNOME, and CDE. In these available systems, all desktops of a user use the same desktop settings. Each of these systems stores the desktop settings in different locations and formats. In embodiments of the extension with desktops which can be individualized, the desktop settings are retrieved, stored and set, either directly, or by an API (Application Program Interface). The extension subscribes at the desktop manager to receive desktop-switch events. The available Unix/Linux systems have different mechanisms for handling events: KDE&#39;s mechanism is based on Trolitech&#39;s GUI class library; GNOME provides its own class library; and CDE is mostly based on X11 events. Irrespective of these differences, in some of the embodiments, the extension: (i) subscribes to receive desktop switch events; (ii) upon receipt of a switch event, stores the desktop settings of the old desktop; (iii) retrieves the stored desktop settings of the new desktop; (iv) assigns project-time information to the respective desktops, e.g. a cessation of work to the old desktop and a commencement of work to the new desktop.  \\n      The embodiments of the computer program product with program code for performing the described methods include any machine-readable medium that is capable of storing or encoding the program code. The term \\u201cmachine-readable medium\\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not to be limited to, solid state memories, optical and magnetic storage media, and carrier wave signals. The program code may be machine code or another code which can be converted into machine code, such as source code in a multi-purpose programming language, e.g. C or C++. The embodiments of a computer include commercially available general-purpose computers programmed with the program code.  \\n      Returning now to  FIG. 1 , it illustrates a GUI with an exemplary virtual desktop  1 . The desktop  1  has a desktop background  2 , for example a blank screen, a regular pattern or a background picture, also called \\u201cwallpaper\\u201d. Different desktop elements are placed on the background  2 , for example link icons  3 , a popup menu  4 , and a control panel  5  with control icons. Active applications are represented by task icons  6  in a task bar  7 . A mouse cursor  9  is a further desktop element; its movement on the desktop  1  represents movements of a pointing device, such as a mouse or a track-ball. There may also be invisible (i.e. purely logical) desktop elements, such as short-cuts (certain combinations of keys) which may, for example, start a task or trigger another activity. The user is able to define and alter the desktop elements, their functions, locations, shapes, and sizes. Furthermore, an application window  8  may be open for some or all of the active applications; it represents an output/input interface to the application it is associated with. Although task icons  6  and application windows  8  are automatically created and deleted when a task is started or stopped, at least the size, shape and location of the application windows in the desktop  1  can be modified by the user. The desktop elements can be defined and configured individually for different virtual desktops as will be illustrated in connection with  FIG. 2 . Since different tasks are associated with the desktops in which they are started, and only these tasks are displayed in the associated desktop, the presence of task icons  6  and application windows  8  is also desktop-individual.  \\n      The GUI of  FIG. 1  also shows multi-desktop-and-project-time control elements, e.g. grouped in a control bar  10 . Strictly speaking, the control bar  10  does not form a part of the desktop  1 , since it serves to control the different virtual desktops and is therefore a kind of \\u201cmeta-control\\u201d element, largely or completely invariant under 7 desktop switches. It has two groups of controls, e.g. in the form of graphical buttons. The first group includes desktop-switch controls  11 , e.g. in the form of graphical buttons. By clicking with the cursor  9  on one of the desktop-switch buttons  11 , the user can initiate a switch to the clicked desktop. The currently displayed (i.e. active) desktop is indicated in the control bar  10 , e.g. by highlighting the desktop-switch button  11  which represents the currently displayed desktop (which is, for example, desktop D 2  in  FIG. 1 ). The second group includes project-time-tracking controls. A start button  12  and a stop button  13  enable the user to indicate a commencement or cessation of work. By clicking on a dead man&#39;s button  14  the user can show that he or she is still present (in other embodiments, the dead man&#39;s button is realized by a shortcut which can be actuated more easily than a graphical button). A project-time-statistics button  15  enables the user to initiate an evaluation and output of project-time-related statistics. A project-time-configuration button  16  gives the user access to a project-time-configuration page (see  FIG. 7  below). The control bar  10  also provides an indication of whether the time currently elapsing is counted as work time or as pause time, e.g. by highlighting the start or stop button, or by a separate indicator element (in the example of  FIG. 1 , the start button  12  is highlighted indicating that the current time is counted as work time).  \\n      In other embodiments, the project-time-related control elements  12 - 16 , or some of them, are not meta-control elements, but are configurable in a desktop-individual way. For example, in some of the desktops, start and stop buttons may be useful, whereas in other desktops no such buttons are displayed. Likewise, in some desktops, no user-feedback is required, so that the dead man&#39;s button is omitted; other desktops requiring user-feedback provide such a button.  \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates a switch from one desktop  1  (\\u201cD 2 \\u201d in the example of  FIG. 2 ) to another desktop  1 \\u2032 (\\u201cD 3 \\u201d in  FIG. 2 ). Desktop  1  displays certain desktop-individual link icons  3  (\\u201cA\\u201d, \\u201cB\\u201d, and \\u201cC\\u201d in  FIG. 2 ). Two tasks, \\u201cTx\\u201d and \\u201cTy\\u201d, are active in the desktop  1  and are indicated by corresponding task icons  6 . For one of these tasks, Ty, an application window  8  is displayed in the desktop  1 . The different desktop elements, such as the link icons  3 , as well as the size and position of application windows  8  are individually defined and configured for each desktop.  \\n      Data indicative of the time spent by the user in the currently active desktop  1  is stored in a manner associated with the current desktop  1 . This is symbolized in  FIG. 2  by desktop-time-related data which is associated with D 2 , and are stored in a desktop-time database  17 . Several alternatives of how desktop-time or project-time data may be recorded are described below in  FIGS. 3-6 .  \\n      When the user initiates a switch-over to another desktop  1 \\u2032, for example by clicking on a desktop-switch button  11  representing a currently inactive desktop (in  FIG. 2 ; D 3 \\u2033), the desktop settings of the old desktop  1  (D 2 ) are persistently stored in an individual-desktop-settings database  18 , and the (previously stored) desktop settings of the new desktop  1 \\u2032 (D 3 ) are retrieved therefrom and are used, instead of the old settings, to build up the new desktop  1 \\u2032. This storage and retrieval of the desktop individual settings is also illustrated in  FIG. 2 . Similarly, data representing the task icons  6 , the application windows  8  as well as application windows settings, such as the position, size and shape of the application windows, are also stored for each desktop, for example in a dedicated application-windows database. As can be seen in the example of  FIG. 2 , different link icons  3 \\u2032 (\\u201cE\\u201d and \\u201cF\\u201d) are displayed at different locations in the new desktop  1 \\u2032. Similarly, different task icons  6  and application windows  8  are displayed in the new desktop  1 \\u2032.  \\n      Since now the new desktop  1 \\u2032 is active, data indicative of time spent are now recorded in a manner associated with the new desktop  1 \\u2032 in the desktop-time database  17 .  \\n       FIG. 3  is a flow diagram illustrating the desktop switching and project-time-tracking-process carried out in the computer.  FIG. 3  shows an embodiment in which the project-time recording is started and stopped by the user switching from one to another desktop. It is assumed that, when the process shown in  FIG. 3  begins, a certain desktop is already active (for example, when the user starts or logs in to the computer, the desktop which was active before the last shutdown or, in a multi-user system, before the last log-out of this user, will be activated again). At  20 , it is ascertained whether a switch event to another desktop has occurred. For example, a switch event may be the user clicking on a desktop-switch button or inputting a desktop-switch shortcut referring to a currently inactive desktop. If the answer is negative, the observation performed at  20  is continued, but no further activity is performed. However, if a switch event is observed, a group of project-time-tracking activities ( 21  and  22 ) and a group of desktop-switch activities ( 23 ,  24  and  25 ) are performed. At  21 , a \\u201cstop\\u201d event is logged, for example together with a user identification (ID) identifying the currently logged-in user, a workstation ID identifying the currently used workstation, an ID of the old desktop used up to now, and data representing the current date and time. At  22 , a \\u201cstart event\\u201d is logged, for example, with the user ID, the workstation ID, the ID of the new desktop, date and time. In other embodiments, only a \\u201cswitch event\\u201d is logged instead of the stop and start events in  21  and  22 . The switch event may indicate the IDs of both the old and the new desktop (in principle, it is even sufficient to log only one of the IDs, for example only the ID of the new desktop, since the previously logged switch event contains the ID of the old desktop). At  23 , the desktop settings of the old desktop are stored. At  24 , previously stored desktop settings of the new desktop are retrieved. At  25 , the new desktop is built up in the graphical user interface, based on the retrieved desktop settings. Then, the process continues with the switch-event observation at  20 . A shut-down or log-out causes a \\u201cstop event\\u201d to be logged, and a start of the computer or log-on causes a \\u201cstart event\\u201d to be logged.  \\n      An alternative embodiment with regard to how the project-time is recorded is also displayed in  FIG. 3 , by dashed lines. This embodiment is not based on logging events from which the project-time may later be calculated, but uses cumulative time counting. For example, a timer is provided which is reset and started when a desktop is activated; hence, its contents represents the time elapsed since the desktop has been activated. Cumulated active-desktop times are persistently stored for all desktops in a desktop-time database. At  21 \\u2032, the contents of the timer, i.e. the time the old desktop has been active since its last activation, is added to the cumulated desktop-time of the old desktop, and the previously stored cumulated value is overwritten by this sum. At  22 \\u2032, the recording of the active time of the new desktop is started by resetting the timer. When the computer is started or the user logs in, only the activity  22 \\u2032 is carried out. There are several variants of the cumulated desktop-time recording. For example, rather than resetting the timer upon activation of a desktop, the timer may start with the desktop time already cumulated for this desktop. If a switch away from this desktop occurs, the contents of the timer already represents the cumulated time; hence, its contents may simply be stored for this desktop (by overwriting the previously stored desktop time for this desktop). In a still further alternative embodiment, the cumulated desktop time stored in the desktop-time database is permanently incremented for the currently active desktop, e.g. every minute. Upon switching from one desktop to another no further storing activity is required since the stored cumulated desktop times are already up to date.  \\n       FIG. 4  is a flow diagram similar to  FIG. 3  of another embodiment in which the project-time recording can be started and stopped independently of a desktop switch. In the embodiment of  FIG. 4 , it is not only ascertained at  20 , whether a switch event has occurred, but also, at  26  and  27 , whether a start event or a stop event has occurred. A start event, for example, may be the user showing activity after a stop, or actuating the start button. A stop event may be a failure to exhibit any user activity for a specified inactivity time, an actuation of the stop button by the user, or a failure to press the \\u201cdeadman&#39;s button\\u201d for more than the accepted dead time. If a start event is observed, it is logged at  22 , or the recording of the active time of the new desktop is started at  22 \\u2032, as explained above in connection with  FIG. 3 . If a stop event is observed, it is logged at  21 , or the recorded active time of the old desktop is added to the cumulated time of the old desktop at  21 \\u2032, as explained above in connection with  FIG. 3 . If a switch event is observed, the group of desktop switch activities  23 ,  24  and  25 , as explained above in connection with  FIG. 3 , is performed. The independence of start and stop events from desktop switch events according to  FIG. 4  enables times in which the user is inactive, or does not want to have the time recorded for other reasons, to be excluded from the project-time recording. Of course, in embodiments rep resented by  FIG. 4 , switch events may also form start and/or stop events. For example, even if a user is able to expressly start and stop project-time recording, it may be assumed that switching to a new desktop implies that the project-time recording ought to be immediately started for the new desktop; the switch event is then also considered as a start event for time recording in the new desktop (and, optionally, as a stop event for time recording in the old desktop, if the project-time recording was active). By contrast, in other embodiments, the user may be required to expressly start the project-time recording after a desktop switch; in such embodiments, a switch to a new desktop may automatically stop the time-recording (if it was active in the old desktop); a switch event is then also considered as a stop event for the time recording in the old desktop.  \\n       FIGS. 5 and 6  illustrate the two different ways of project-time tracking (which have already been mentioned above in  FIGS. 3 and 4 ) in more detail.  \\n      According to the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 5 , upon appearance of an event, such as a switch event, a start or stop event, or a log-in or log-out event, a record is written in the desktop-time database, which is here, for example, in the form of an event-log file  29 . Each record may indicate the event type, the ID of the active desktop, and the date and time of the event. In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 5 , five different event types are logged; log-in, log-out, switch to, start, and stop. Although a \\u201cswitch to\\u201d event implies a stop of the time recording in the desktop active up to the switch and a start of the time recording in the desktop active after the switch, these \\u201cimplied events\\u201d are not expressly logged in  FIG. 5 . Similarly, although a log-in implies a start of the desktop-time recording (e.g. in a default desktop, or the desktop which was used by the present user the last time) and a logs-out implies a stop of the time recording, the corresponding start and stop events are not expressly logged. Rather, in  FIG. 8 , only start and stop events which appear within a desktop session are recorded (e.g. starts and stops triggered by the user actuating the start or stop button). In other embodiments, such \\u201cimplied\\u201d start and stop events are also logged, to introduce some redundancy.  \\n      In regular intervals, or when the user actively requests a report on the time spent by him or her on the different projects (e.g. by clicking on the statistics button  15  in  FIG. 1 ), a report is prepared by the multi-desktop-and-project-time-tracking system. Using the events in the log file  29 , the times during which the different desktops were active, excluding those time intervals when the time recording during a desktop session was stopped, is individually calculated for the different desktops. In the example of  FIG. 1 , for desktop \\u201c 1 \\u201d a desktop time of 0:25 h between the \\u201clog-in\\u201d and the \\u201cswitch/to/desktop  3 \\u201d is obtained, for desktop \\u201c 2 \\u201d a desktop time of 2:23 h between the \\u201cswitch/to/desktop  2 \\u201d and the \\u201cstop  2 \\u201d and between the \\u201cstart  2 \\u201d and the \\u201clog-out\\u201d is obtained, and for desktop \\u201c 3 \\u201d a desktop time of 0:46 h between the \\u201cswitch-to desktop  3 \\u201d and the \\u201cswitch/to/desktop  2 \\u201d event is obtained. In embodiments with a 1:1 relationship between desktops and projects the desktop times obtained in this way already represent the project times of the projects to which the desktops are assigned (in the simplest case, the desktop numbers correspond to project numbers, so that the report could simply state the desktop number/project number and the corresponding desktop/project time; in other embodiments, different project identifiers may be mapped to the desktops and included in the report). In the more general case of a N:1 relationship a corresponding mapping  30  between desktops and projects is provided. In the example of  FIG. 5 , two desktops (desktops \\u201c 1 \\u201d and \\u201c 3 \\u201d) are mapped to one and the same project (project \\u201c 1 \\u201d). Based on the mapping  30 , the desktop times (calculated as described above for 1:1 relationships) assigned to the same project are added. Correspondingly, the exemplary project-time report  31  in  FIG. 5  states that the time spent on project \\u201c 1 \\u201d is 1:11 h, on project \\u201c 2 \\u201d 2:23 h, and on project \\u201c 3 \\u201d 0:00 h.  \\n      In other embodiments, the N:1 mapping is already applied when the events are written to the log file; the data records then include a project ID. The project times are then obtained by adding the time intervals between switch events and start/stop events individually for each project ID taking into account the mapping from desktop to projects, analogously to what has been explained above for desktop times in the case of a 1:1 relationship.  \\n      According to the other embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 6 , the project-time tracking is based on cumulating project or desktop times. In the embodiment of  FIG. 6 , the time elapsing in an active desktop from switching to this desktop, or starting the time recording in this desktop, to switching to another desktop, or stopping the time recording; is recorded by a timer  32 . For example, exemplary  FIG. 6  illustrates the point of time immediately before the log-out in  FIG. 5 ; the desktop time recorded in  32  therefore refers to desktop  2 , and the recorded time is 1.45 h. Cumulated desktop times for each desktop are stored in the desktop-times database  17 , here, for example, in the form of a table. In  FIG. 6 , an exemplary snapshot representing the table&#39;s state immediately before the log-out of  FIG. 5  is shown at  33 \\u2032. It includes the cumulated desktop times of all desktops up to \\u201cstart  2 \\u201d of  FIG. 5 ; the current desktop session in desktop \\u201c 2 \\u201d, lasting from \\u201cstart  2 \\u201d to the log-out is not yet included in the cumulated-desktop-times table. At the end of the current desktop session, i.e. upon the log-out in  FIG. 5 , the desktop time recorded in  32  is added to the data record of the cumulated desktop-times table referring to the current desktop, i.e. to desktop \\u201c2\\u201d. The resulting snapshot of the table is shown at  33 \\u2033 in  FIG. 6 . In the case of an 1:1 relationship, the cumulated times contained in the cumulated-desktop-times table already represent the project times, and can immediately be output in a project-time report. In the case of an N:1 relationship, the cumulated desktop times are mapped to project times, by mappings  30 , as described in connection with  FIG. 5 . Finally, a project-time report  31  is prepared, as in  FIG. 5 .  \\n      In other embodiments of the cumulated-project-time recording similar to  FIG. 6 , the timer  32  is not reset upon a switch or start event, but the timer  32  is started with already cumulated desktop time for the current desktop read in from the table in the state  33 \\u2032, and is increased as time elapses during the current desktop session. When the session is terminated, the time recorded then by the timer  32  is written back to the cumulated-desktop-times table, which then results in a snapshot as  33 \\u2033. In still another embodiment, instead of using a timer, the table&#39;s record pertaining to the presently active desktop is constantly updated, e.g. incremented every minute. In all three cases, at the end of the session (i.e. when the log-out happens), the snapshot  33 \\u2033 is obtained.  \\n       FIG. 7  shows an exemplary interface  35  of a configurator of the multi-desktop-and-project-time-tracking system which may be activated by the user, e.g. by clicking on configuration button  16  in  FIG. 1 . The configurator enables the user to define the settings of the project-time-recording system described so far. Upon starting the configurator, the graphical configuration interface  35  is displayed in an application window. The user can specify the total number of virtual desktops in an edit box  36  and the total number of projects in an edit box  39 . For each desktop, the user can specify a desktop label and the ID of the project to which the desktop is assigned, in edit boxes  37  and  38 . A text description of each project can be entered at  40 . Several controls for the definition of start and stop events are provided, for example a control  41  for activating the start/stop buttons, a control  42  by which the user can define that time recording is to be started with user activity, a control  43  by which the user can define that the time tracking is stopped in the case of inactivity for a user-definable time period, and control  44  by which the dead-man&#39;s button functionality can be activated and the accepted dead time be defined. Finally, by means of pull-down menus  45 , the user can choose a period after which project-time reports are automatically generated, the file type of the reports and the location where they are stored.  \\n       FIG. 8  is a diagrammatic representation of layers of a computer including multi-desktop-and-project-time tracking software for an exemplary Unix/Linux system. The lowest layer is a hardware layer  51  including a CPU, memory, disks, a terminal, a clock, etc. The other layers are software layers; the lowest software layer is the kernel  52  of the operating system. It is responsible for process management, memory management, the file system, input/output, etc. and runs in kernel mode. On top of the kernel  52  is a layer  53  including utility programs of the operating system, including the GUI, the window management system, the virtual-desktop management which enables the user to switch between different desktops with individually definable link icons, the project-time tracking system, etc. On top of the utility programs layer  53  are user applications  54 . The utility programs  53  and the user applications  54  run in user mode. In other operating systems, for example Windows operating systems, a number of the utility programs also run in kernel mode, and hence belong to the kernel. In some of these embodiments, the virtual-desktop-and-project-time tracking system also belongs to the kernel, it may then be an integrated part of the Windows operating system. In other embodiments, however, the entire or a part of the multi-desktop-and-project-time tracking system runs in user mode, for example when it is an extension to current Windows operating systems.  \\n       FIG. 9  is a high-level architecture diagram of a multi-desktop-and-project-time-tracking system  56 . It includes a multi-desktop manager  57  with a pager  58 , a project-time tracker  59 , a project-time statistics evaluator  60 , a configurator  61  as well as databases  18 ,  17  for storing individual-desktop settings data and project-time data. The multi-desktop manager  57  provides the desktop-switch functionality described above. The pager  58  displays the desktop-switch buttons  11  of  FIG. 1  and, upon actuation of one of them, causes the multi-desktop manager  57  to perform the requested desktop switch. In order to provide the different desktops with individually-definable link icons, and other desktop settings, the multi-desktop manager  57  stores the desktop settings of the old desktops in, and retrieves the ones of the new desktop from, the individual-desktop-settings database  18 . The multi-desktop manager  57  is also responsible for providing the other controls of the multi-desktop-and-project-time-control bar  10  of  FIG. 1 , for example the start and stop buttons  12 ,  13 , the dead-man&#39;s button  14 , the project-time statistics button  15  and the project-time configuration button  16  of  FIG. 1 , based on specifications by the configurator  61  (which, in turn, may be entered by the user by means of the configurator&#39;s interface shown in  FIG. 7 ). If an event relevant for project-time tracking occurs (be it a switch event, or another event indicative of a start or stop of work, such as an actuation of the start and stop buttons, exhibiting user activity after a stop, or failure to exhibit such an activity for a specified time, not operating the dead-man&#39;s button, etc.), the multi-desktop manager  57  notifies the project-time tracker  59  of the event. For example, the project-time tracker  59  may be subscribed at the multi-desktop manager  57  to receive such events; if an event occurs, the multi-desktop manager  57  then actively notifies the project-time tracker  59 . In alternative embodiments, the project-time tracker  69  regularly sends notification requests to the multi-desktop manager  57 , and if an event has occurred since the last notification request, the multi-desktop manager  57  returns the requested event notification to the project-time tracker  59 .  \\n      The project-time tracker  59  provides the project-time-tracking functionality described above. On the basis of event notifications, and information received from the multi-desktop manager  57  (i.e. information identifying the currently active desktop and/or the desktop from which or to which a switch is carried out), the project-timer tracker stores event-representing data in the desktop-time database  17 , or increases cumulated desktop-time counters in the desktop-time database  17 , as described in connection with  FIGS. 5 and 6 .  \\n      The project-time statistics evaluator  60  prepares project-time reports  31  based on data in the project-time database  17 , as described in connection with  FIGS. 5 and 6 . The reports are prepared on user request (the user may, for example, actuate the statistics button  15  ( FIG. 1 )), or on a regular basis.  \\n      The configurator  61  provides the graphical configuration interface  35  ( FIG. 7 ) to the user and configures the multi-desktop manager  57  with the pager  58 , the project-time tracker  59  and the project-time statistics evaluator  60  in accordance with the settings of the project-time-recording system defined by the user via the configuration interface  35 .  \\n       FIG. 10  is an architecture diagram similar to  FIG. 9  illustrating an embodiment in which the multi-desktop-and-project-time-tracking system  56  is formed by an extension  63  to a MS Windows operating system. In  FIG. 10 , only the relevant parts of the MS Windows operating system are reproduced, i.e. the usual single-desktop manager  64  including an API  65  and a Windows desktop directory  66 , as well as a part of the Windows registry  67 .  \\n      The switching between two desktops is performed by minimizing all open application windows, storing representations of the desktop elements of the old desktop and removing the desktop elements from the GUI, retrieving desktop-elements representations of the new desktop and displaying the retrieved elements in the GUI, and eventually maximizing application windows of tasks associated with the new desktop. Thereby, tasks associated with non-active desktops keep on running in the background, and their application windows are only minimized and resized.  \\n      In MS Windows, data representing the desktop elements of the (single) desktop are stored in the desktop directory  66 . Data representing the positions of the desktop elements are stored at  68  within the Windows registry  67  at  68 . In order to provide the multi-desktop manager functionality described in connection with  FIG. 9 , a multi-desktop extension  57 \\u2032 with a pager  58  is provided. It is similar to the multi-desktop manager  57  and pager  58  of  FIG. 9 , but uses the functionality of the single-desktop manager  64  already provided by the MS Windows operating system. In order to perform a desktop switch, it retrieves the data representing the desktop elements, and their positions, of the old desktop from the desktop directory  66  and the Windows registry  67 , stores them in the individual-desktop-settings database  18 , and then retrieves the corresponding data for the new desktop from the individual desktop settings database  18  and stores them in the desktop directory  66  and the registry  67  at  68 . Application windows associated with the old desktop are minimized (and may also be removed from the task bar), and application windows associated with the new desktop are resized (and may now also be iconized in the task bar). As a consequence, the desktop elements, application windows and task icons of the old desktop disappear from the GUI and their functionality is inactivated, whereas the ones of the new desktop are displayed in the GUI, and their functionality is activated. This represents a virtual-desktop switch for the user. Some of the functions of the project-time-tracking extension  56  are based on functions provided by the MS Windows operating system. For example, the multi-desktop-and-project-time-control bar  10  ( FIG. 1 ) is implemented via the API  65 , and the operating system notifies the multi-desktop extension  57 \\u2032 via the API  65  if a control of the control bar  10  is actuated. Concerning further features and functions, the multi-desktop-and-project-time-tracking extension  63  is similar to the system  56  described in connection with  FIG. 9 , so that reference is made to the description of  FIG. 9  above.  \\n       FIG. 11  is an architecture diagram similar to  FIG. 10  illustrating another embodiment in which the virtual-desktop-and-project-time-tracking system  56  is mainly formed by an extension  69  to a Unix/Linux operating system. Current Unix/Linux-based GUIs, such as KDE, GNOME, CDE, already provide a multi-desktop function ality. Consequently, the relevant part of the operating system reproduced in  FIG. 11  is a multi-desktop manager  64 \\u2033, including a pager  58 \\u2033, an API  65 \\u2033, and a desktop-settings database  70 . Although the Unix/Linux operating systems provide a multi-desktop functionality, the desktop settings stored at  70  are the same for all desktops of one and the same user. Hence, the different desktops differ only with regard to tasks and application windows, but display the same link icons and other desktop elements. (Since Unix/Linux are multi-user operating systems, another user may have different desktop settings. However, to display the different desktop, the other user has to log in to the computer. Herein, activation of a different desktop due to a log-in, log-out, or switch to another user, is not considered a \\u201cdesktop switch\\u201d).  \\n      The project-time tracking extension  69  uses the multi-desktop functionality of the Unix/Linux operating systems. A desktop extension  57 \\u2032 enables individual desktop elements to be displayed upon a desktop switch, by storing the desktop settings of the old desktop stored at  70  in the individual-desktop-settings database  18 , retries ing the desktop settings of the new desktop from the database  18  and storing them at  70 , either directly or via the API  65 \\u2033. The desktop extension  57 \\u2033 is subscribed at the multi-desktop manager  64 \\u2033 to receive desktop-switch events as well as other events relevant to project-time tracking, such as start and stop events, e.g. triggered by an actuation of the start or stop button  12 ,  13  ( FIG. 1 ). When such an event occurs, e.g. when the user switches to another desktop by means of the pager  58 \\u2033, the API  65 \\u2033 notifies the desktop extension  57 \\u2033 of the event. In some of the embodiments, the multi desktop manager  64 \\u2033 also informs the desktop extension  57 \\u2033 which one of the desktops is currently active (in other embodiments this may be omitted since the switch event carries sufficient information). Concerning further features and functions, the project-time-tracking extension  56  is similar to the system described in connection with  FIGS. 9 and 10 , so that reference is made to the description of  FIGS. 9 and 10  above.  \\n      The hardware  51  shown in  FIG. 8  may include primary storage, such as a main memory, a static memory and/or a volatile memory. It may further include secondary storage, such as magnetic and/or optic disk storage devices. The software embodying the multi-desktop-and-project-time-tracking system  56  ( FIG. 9 ) or the corresponding extensions  63  and  69  ( FIGS. 10 and 11 ), or any other of the methodologies described above, is a set of instructions residing, completely, or at least partially, within the first and/or second storages. The software may further be transmitted or received via a network interface of the computer in the form of carrier wave signals.  \\n      All publications and existing systems mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference.  \\n      Although certain methods and products constructed in accordance with the teachings of the invention have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto.

Given the rapidity with which new emerging pathogens can appear, it is important to improve animal models that could be used to evaluate vaccination strategies and the protective capacity of different epitopes quickly and reliably. Furthermore, in vivo studies are already required to assess crucial variables of vaccine behavior that are not easily evaluated or impossible to measure in vitro, such as vaccine immunogenicity, vaccine formulation, route of administration, tissue distribution, and involvement of primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Because of their simplicity and flexibility, small animals, such as mice represent an attractive alternative to more cumbersome and expensive model systems, such as nonhuman primates, at least for initial vaccine development studies.  \\n      The moderate efficacy observed in several clinical trials of vaccines, which were found to be protective in wild-type animal studies (McMichael, A. J. &amp; Hanke, T.  Nat Med  9, 874-880 (2003)), may be partly explained by the different influence that human and animal MHC have on the outcome of the immune response, since animal MHC and human HLA molecules do not present the same optimal epitopes (Rotzschke, O. et al.  Nature  348, 252-254 (1990)). Thus, despite some limitations, transgenic mice expressing human HLA should represent a useful improvement over wild-type mice as a preclinical model for testing vaccine candidates, evaluating the potential risk that the vaccines could induce autoimmune disorders, and devising better therapeutic strategies based on the human restriction element.  \\n      Cytotoxic T Cells  \\n      Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) play a crucial role in the eradication of infectious diseases and in some cases, cancer (P. Aichele, H. Hengartner, R. M. Zinkernagel and M. Schulz, J Exp Med 171 (1990), p.1815; L. BenMohamed, H. Gras-Masse, A. Tartar, P. Daubersies, K Brahimi, M. Bossus, A. Thomas and P. Druhile, Eur J Immunol 27 (1997), p. 1242; D. J. Diamond, J. York, J. Sun, C. L. Wright and S. J. Forman, Blood 90 (1997), p. 1751). Recombinant protein vaccines do not reliably induce CTL responses (Habeshaw J A, Dalgleish A G, Bountiff L, Newell A L, Wilks, D, Walker L C, Manca F. November 1990; 11 (11): 418-25; Miller S B, Tse H, Rosenspire A J, King S R. Virology. December 1992; 191 (2):9 73-7). The use of otherwise immunogenic vaccines consisting of attenuated pathogens in humans is hampered, in several important diseases, by overriding safety concerns. In the last few years, epitope-based approaches have been proposed as a possible strategy to develop novel prophylactic and immunotherapeutic vaccines (Melief C J, Offringa R, Toes R E, Kast W M. Curr Opin Immunol. October 1996, 8(5):651-7; Chesnut R W, Design testing of peptide based cytotoxic T-cell mediated immunotherapeutic to treat infiction disease, cancer, in Ppowell, M F, Newman, M J (eds.): Vaccine Design: The Subunit, Adjuvant Approach, Plenum Press, New-York 1995, 847). This approach offers several advantages, including selection of naturally processed epitopes, which forces the immune system to focus on highly conserved and immunodominant epitopes of a pathogen (R. G. van der Most, A. Sette, C. Oseroff, J. Alexander, K. Murali-Krishna, L. L. Lau, S, Southwood, J. Sidney, R. W. Chesnut, M. Matioubian and R. Ahmed, J Immunol 157 (1996), p. 5543) and induction of multiepitopic responses to prevent escape by mutation such observed in HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. It also allows the elimination of suppressive T cell determinants, which might preferably elicit a TH2 response, in conditions where a TH1 responses is desirable, or vice-versa (Pfeiffer C, Murray J, Madri J, Bottomly K. Immunol Rev. October 1991; 123:65-84; P Chaturvedi, Q Yu, S Southwood, A Sette, and B Singh Int Immunol 1996 8: 745-755). It finally provides the possibility to get rid of autoimmune T cell determinants in antigens, which might induce undesirable autoimmune diseases. Protective antiviral or anti-tumoral immunity using CTL epitope-peptides has been achieved in several experimental models (D. J. Diamond, J. York, J. Sun, C. L. Wright and S. J. Forman, Blood 90 1997, p.1751; J. E. J. Blaney, E. Nobusawa, M. A. Brehm, R. H. Bonneau, L. M. Mylin, T. M. Fu, Y. Kawaoka and S. S. Tevethia, J Virol 72 (1998), p. 9567).  \\n      CTL epitope definition based on the usage of human lymphocytes might be misleading due to environmental and genetic heterogeneity that lead to incomplete results, and due to technical difficulties in isolating CTL clones. HLA class I or class II transgenic mice described to date have proved to be a valuable tool to overcome these limitations as illustrated by the identification with such animal models of novel CTL and T helper epitopes (Hill A V. Annu Rev Immunol. 1998;16:593-617; Carmon L, El-Shami K M, Paz A., Pascolo S, Tzehoval E, Tirosb B, Koren R, Feldman M, Fridkin M, Lemonnier F A, Eisenbach L. Int J Cancer, Feb. 1, 2000; 85(3):391-7). These mice have also been used to demonstrate: i) good correlation between peptide HLA binding affinity and immunogenicity (Lustgarten J, Theobald M, Labadie C, LaFace D, Peterson P, Disis M L, Cheaver M A, Sherman L A. Hum Immunol. Febuary 1997; 52(2):109-18; Bakker A B, van der Burg S H, Huijbens R J, DRijfhout J W, Melief C J, Adema G J, Figdor C G. Int J Cancer. January 27, 1997; 70(3):302-9), ii) significant overlap between the murine and human CTL system at the level of antigen processing (same epitopes generated), and iii) comparable mobilization against most antigens of the CTL repertoires in HLA transgenic mice and humans (Wentworth, P. A., A. Vifiello, J. Sidney, E. Keogh, P, W. Chesnut, H. Grey, A. Sette. 1996. Eur. J. Immunol. 26:97; Alexander, J., C. Oserof, J. Sidney, P. Wentworth, E. Keogh, G. Hermanson, F. V. Chisari R. T, Kubo, H. M, Grey, A, Sette, 1997. J. Immunol. 159:4753).  \\n      To date, synthetic peptide-based CTL epitope vaccines have been developed as immunotherapeutics against a number of human diseases [18-20]. However, only moderate efficacy was observed in several clinical trials (21). This may be partly explained by the failure of these vaccines to induce sufficiently strong CTL responses. Indeed, recent reports suggest the need for CD4+ T-cell help to obtain maximum CTL response (A. J. Zajac, K. Murali-Krishna, J. N. Blattman and R. Ahmed, Curr Opin Immunol 10 (1998), p. 444; Firat H, Garcia-Pons F, Tourdot S, Pascolo S, Scardino A, Garcia. Z, Michel M L, Jack R W, Jung O, Kosmatopoulos K, Mateo L, Suhrbier A, Lemonnier F A, Langlade-Dernoyen P Eur J Immunol 29, 3112,1999).  \\n      CTL are critical components of protective immunity against viral infections, but the requirements for in vivo priming of CTL are not completely understood. It is now accepted that Th cells are usually essential for CTL priming with synthetic peptides. With respect to synthetic CTL epitopic peptides, several studies point to a mandatory need for Th lymphocyte stimulation to induce optimal CTL responses (C. Fayolle, E. Deriaud and C. Leclerc, J Immunol 147 (1991), p, 4069; C. Widmann, P. Romero, J. L. Maryanski, G. Corradin and D. Valmori, J Immunol Meth 155 (1992), p. 95; M. Shirai, C. D. Pendkton, J. Ahlers, T. Takeshita, M. Newman and J. A. Berzofsky, J Immunol 152 (1994), p. 549; J. P. Sauet, H. Gras-Masse, J. G. Guillet and E. Gomard, Int Immunol 8 (1996). p. 457). Several of these studies showed that activation of a CD8+ T cell requires simultaneous interaction of a CD4+ T helper cell and a CD8+ T cell with the same antigen-presenting cell presenting their cognate epitopes (Ridge J P, Di Rosa F, Matzinger P. Nature. Jun. 4, 1998; 3 93 (6684):474-8). The relevance of this three-cell interaction for priming of CTLs is confirmed by studies with viral epitopes, and animal models, since in vivo induction of CTLs was most efficient when CTL and Th epitopes were physically linked rather than administered as an unlinked mixture (Shirai M, Pendleton C D, Ahlers J, Takeshita T, Newman M, Berzohky J A. J Immunol. Jan. 15, 1994; 152(2): 549-56; Oseroff C, Sette A, Wentworth P, Celis E, Maewal A, Dahlberg C, Fikes J, Kubo R T, Chesnut R W, Grey B X Alexander J. Vaccine. May 1998; 16(8): 823-33). The capacity of CTL and Th antigenic peptides to efficiently induce CTL responses has been demonstrated both in experimental models (C. Fayolle, E. Deriaud and C. Leclerc, J Immunol 147 (1991), p, 4069; C. Widmann, P. Romero, J. L. Maryanski, G. Corradin and D. Valmori, J Immunol Meth 155 (1992), p. 95) and in humans (A. Vitiello, G. Ishioka, H. M. Grey, R. Rose, P. Famess, R. LaFond, L. Yuan, F. V. Chisari, J. Furze and R. Bartholomeuz, J Clin Invest 95 (1995), p. 341; B. Livingston, C. Crimi, H. Grey, G. Ishioka, F. V. Chisari, J. Fikes, H. M. Grey, R. Chesnut and A. Sette, J Immunol 159 (1997), p.1383). Moreover, a potent Th response plays an important role not only for optimal induction of CTL responses, but also for maintenance of CTL memory (E. A. Walter, P. D. Greenberg, M. J. Gilbert, R. J. Finch, K-S. Watanabe, E. D. Tbomas and S. R. Riddell, N Engl J Med 333 (1995), p.1038; Riddell S R, Greenberg P D, In Thomas E D, Blume K G, Forman S J (eds): Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, 2nd edn. Maiden, MA: Blackwell Science Inc., 1999). Finally, it has long been documented that CD4+ T \\u201chelper\\u201d cells are crucial in coordinating cellular and humoral immune responses against exogenous antigens.  \\n      Recently, a transgenic (Tg) mouse that expresses both HLA-A*0201 class I and HLA-DR1 class II molecules was established (BenMohamed L, Krishnan R, Longmate J, Auge C, Low L, Primus J, Diamond D J, Hum, Immunol. August 2000;61 (8):764-79). The authors reported that both HLA-A*0201 and HLA-DR1 transgenes are functional in vivo, that both MHC class I and class II molecules were utilized as restriction elements, and that the product of the HLA-DR1 transgene enhances the HLA-A*0201-restricted antigen-specific CTL responses (BenMohamed L, Krishnan R, Longmate J, Auge C, Low L, Primus J, Diamond D J, Hum, Immunol. August 2000;61 (8):764-79).  \\n      It is noteworthy that these HLA-A*0201/DR1 Tg mice expressed their own MHC H-2 class I and class II molecules. Because HLA class I transgenic mice expressing endogenous mouse MHC class I genes preferentially and often exclusively develop H-2 restricted CTL response (C Barra, H Gournier, Z Garcia, P N Marche, E Jouvin-Marche, P Briand, P Fillipi, and F A Lemonnier J Immunol 1993 150: 3681-3689; Epstein H, Hardy F., May J S, Johnson M H, Holmes N. Eur J Immunol. September 1989;19(9):1575-83; Le A X; E J Bernhard, M J Holterman, S Strub, P Parham, E Lacy, and V H Engelhard J Immunol 1989 142: 13 66-1371; Vitiello A, Marchesini D, Furze J, Sherman L A, Chesnut R W., J Exp Med. Apr. 1, 1991;173(4):100715), and HLA class II transgenic mice expressing endogenous mouse MHC class II genes fail to induce reliable HLA class II restricted antigen-specific responses (Nishimura Y, Iwanaga T, Inamitsu T, Yanagawa Y, Yasunami M, Kimura A, Hirokawa K, Sasazuki T., J Immunol Jul. 1, 1990;145(1):353-60), these HLA-A*0201/DR1 Tg mice are of limited utility to assess human-specific responses to antigen.  \\n      However, in HLA class I transgenic H-2 class I knock-out mice, or HLA class II transgenic H-2 class II knock-out mice, only HLA-restricted CTL immune responses occur (Pascolo S, Bervas N, Ure J M, Smith A G, Lemonnier F A, Perarnau, B., J Exp Med. Jun. 16, 1997;185(12).2043-51; Madsen L, Labrecque N, Engberg J, Dierich A, Svejgaard A, Benoist C, Mathis D, Fugger L. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA\\u2014Aug. 31, 1999;96(18):10338-43). In fact, HLA-A2.1-transgenic H-2 class I-knock-out (KO) mice exhibit the ability to mount enhanced HLA-A2.1-restricted responses as compared to HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice that still express the endogenous murine H-2 class I molecules (Pascolo, S. et al.  J Exp Med  185, 2043-2051 (1997); Ureta-Vidal, A., Firat, H., Perarnau, B. &amp; Lemonnier, F. A.  J Immunol  163, 2555-2560 (1999); Firat, H. et al.,  Int Immunol  14, 925-934 (2002); Rohrlich, P. S. et al.,  Int Immunol  15, 765-772 (2003)). The inventors have made similar observations with HLA-DR1-transgenic mice, depending on whether or not they are deficient in H-2 class II molecules (A. Pajot, unpublished results). Furthermore, in the absence of competition from murine MHC molecules, the HLA-A2.1-transgenic H-2 class I-KO or HLA-DRI-transgenic H-2 class II-KO mice generate only HLA-restricted immune responses (Pascolo, S. et al.  J Exp Med  185, 2043-2051 (1997)) (A. Pajot, unpublished results), facilitating the monitoring of HLA-restricted CD8 +  and CD4 +  T cell responses. However, protective immune responses against pathogens, which often require collaboration between T helper and cytotoxic CD8 +  T cells, cannot be studied in the single HLA class I- or HLA class II-transgenic mice, which do not allow the simultaneous assessment of HLA class I and II human responses in the same mouse.  \\n      Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for a convenient animal model system to test the immunogenicity of human vaccine candidates comprising constructs containing human CTL epitopes and, in some cases, with the inclusion of high potency CD4+ Th (helper T lymphocyte) epitopes to sustain antiviral and antitumoral CD8+ T-cell activity (A. J. Zajac, K. Murali-Krishna, J. N. Blattman and R. Ahmed, Curr Opin Immunol 10 (1998), p. 444; Firat H, Garcia-Pons F, Tourdot S, Pascolo S, Scardino A, Garcia Z, Michel M L, Jack R W, Jung O, Kosmatopoulos K, Mateo L, Suhrbier A, Lemonnier F A, Langlade-Dernoyen P, Eur J Immunol 29,3112, 1999). There is also a need for a system that allows the simultaneous assessment of the mutual coordination between a CTL response, a TH response (in particular s TH 1  or TH 2  response), and, optionally, a humoral response.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The inventors have met this need and more by providing mice transgenic for both HLA-A2.1 and HLA-DR1 molecules, in a background that is deficient for both H-2 class I and class II molecules. Specifically, the invention provides mice comprising (1) mutated H-2 class I and class II molecules; and (2) expressing HLA class I transgenic molecules, or HLA class II transgenic molecules, or HLA class I transgenic molecules and HLA class II transgenic molecules. These mice provide a model useful in the development and optimization of vaccine constructs with maximum in vivo immunogenicity for human use. Specifically, such mice enable a complete analysis of the three components of the immune adaptive response (antibody, helper and cytolytic) in a single animal, as well as an evaluation of the protection specifically conferred by vaccination against an antigenic challenge.  \\n      Mice of the invention, which comprise a knock-out for both H-2 class I and class II molecules, and express HLA class I transgenic molecules and HLA class II transgenic molecules represent a completely humanized experimental mouse that can be used to simultaneously detect the presence of antigen-specific antibodies, an antigen-specific HLA-DRI restricted T cell response, and an antigen-specific HLA-A2 restricted T cell response. These mice will be useful to study how mutual coordination operates between a CTL response, a TH response (in particular a TH 1  or TH 2  response), and, optionally, a humoral response. These mice represent an optimized tool for basic and applied vaccinology studies.  \\n      A first embodiment of the invention provides a transgenic mouse comprising a disrupted H2 class I gene, a disrupted H2 class II gene, and a functional HLA class I or class II transgene.  \\n      A second embodiment of the invention provides a transgenic mouse comprising a disrupted H2 class I gene, a disrupted H2 class II gene, a functional HLA class I transgene, and a functional HLA class II transgene.  \\n      In some embodiments, the HLA class I transgene is an HLA-A2 transgene and the HLA class II transgene is an HLA-DR1 transgene.

These mice represent an optimized tool for basic and applied vaccinology studies.  \\n      The invention provides transgenic mouse comprising a disrupted H2 class I gene, a disrupted H2 class II gene, and a functional HLA class I or class II transgene. In some embodiments, the transgenic mouse comprises a disrupted H2 class I gene, a disrupted H2 class II gene, a functional HLA class I transgene, and a functional HLA class II transgene. Such a mouse can be said to be a completely humanized experimental mouse, because it can be used to simultaneously detect the presence of antigen-specific antibodies, an antigen-specific HLA-DRI restricted T cell response, and an antigen-specific HLA-A2 restricted T cell response.  \\n      As shown, in part, in the Examples provided herein, and as is generally clear to one of skill in the art from the disclosure, HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice have the capacity to develop HBsAg-specific antibody, CD4 +  helper and CD8 +  cytolytic T cell responses following DNA immunization. These responses, observed in every single mouse tested, were directed at the same immunodominant epitopes as human responses and conferred to the immunized animals specific protection against a HBsAg recombinant vaccinia virus.  \\n      T helper cells are essential for full maturation of antibody responses (Katz, D. H. &amp; Benacerraf, B.,  Adv Immunol  15, 1-94 (1972)) CTL priming against many epitopes (von Boehmer, H. &amp; Haas, W.,  J Exp Med  150, 1134-1142 (1979); Keene, J. A. &amp; Forman, J.,  J Exp Med  155, 768-782 (1982)) and CTL long-term maintenance (Matloubian, M., Concepcion, R. J. &amp; Ahmed, R.,  J Virol  68, 8056-8063 (1994)). Both antibodies (Lefrancois, L.,  J Virol  51, 208-214 (1984)) and CTL (Zinkernagel, R. M. &amp; Welsh, R. M.,  J Immunol  117, 1495-1502 (1976)) are critical components of protective immunity against viral infections. Potent HBsAg-specific antibody and CTL responses were in fact observed in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-double transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice, but not in HLA-A2.1-single transgenic, H-2 class I-/ class II-KO mice. Thus, HBsAg-specific CD4 +  T cell help is essential for generating efficient HBsAg-specific CTL and antibody responses. These results are consistent with studies on HBsAg-immunized mice (Milich, D. R.,  Semin Liver Dis  11, 93-112(1991)) and HBsAg-vaccinated humans (Celis, E., Kung, P. C. &amp; Chang, T. W.,  J Immunol  132, 1511-1516 (1984)), which suggest that production of an anti-HBs antibody response is dependent on CD4 +  T cells.  \\n      Transgenic mice expressing both HLA-A2.1 class I and HLA-DR1 class II molecules have already been derived (BenMohamed, L. et al.  Hum Immunol  61, 764-779 (2000)). The authors reported that both the HLA-A2.I and HLA-DR1 molecules are functional restriction elements in vivo and that the product of the HLA-DR1 transgene enhances the HLA-A2.1-restricted antigen-specific CTL responses. However, the human relevance of the immune responses in these mice is dwarfed by the fact that they still expressed their own H-2 class I and class II molecules, which are usually preferentially and often exclusively used as restricting elements in response to antigens (Ureta-Vidal, A., Firat, H., Perarnau, B. &amp; Lemonnier, F. A.,  J Immunol  163, 2555-2560 (1999); Rohrlich, P. S. et al.,  Int Immunol  15, 765-772 (2003)) (A. Pajot, unpublished results). The invention described herein overcomes this limitation by providing HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice.  \\n      In some embodiments the HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice express, in a \\u03b22m-KO context, a HLA-A2.1 monochain in which the human \\u03b22m is covalently linked by a peptidic arm to the HLA-A2.1 heavy chain. They further lack cell surface expression of conventional H-2 IA and IE class II molecules as a result of the inactivation of the H-2 IA\\u03b2 b  gene, since H-2 IE\\u03b1 is a pseudogene in the H-2 b  haplotype. The results provided herein demonstrate that such mice are deprived of cell surface expression of H-2 class I and class II molecules. However, it was reported in one case that a free class I heavy chain, in particular H-2 D b , may exist on the surface of a \\u03b22m-KO mouse, and could induce an alloreactivity response. Even if this is so, because such mice are empty of peptide, they should not interfere in antigen-specific immune response (Bix, M. &amp; Raulet, D.,  J Exp Med  176, 829-834 (1992)). This is supported by the report of Allen et al (Allen, H., Fraser, J., Flyer, D., Calvin, S. &amp; Flavell, R.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  83, 7447-7451 (1986)), in which they confirmed that H-2 D b  is expressed at the cell surface even when there is no \\u03b22m present within the cell, but that such D b  antigen is recognized by neither D b -allospecific or D b -restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, D b  antigens are not recognized by most monoclonal antibodies of the native D b .  \\n      Nonetheless, in HLA-DR\\u03b1 single transgenic mice, it was reported that unconventional HLA-DR\\u03b1/H-2 IE\\u03b2 b  hybrid complexes may be expressed to some extent on the cell surface, at least in the absence of the HLA-DR\\u03b2 chain (Lawrance, S. K. et al.,  Cell  58, 583-594 (1989)). In spite of this observation, these unconventional molecules were not detected serologically on cell surfaces in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice, even with mAb (17-3-3S), which is known to react with such hybrid molecules (Ozato, K., Mayer, N. &amp; Sachs, D. H.,  J Immunol  124, 533-540 (1980)) ( FIG. 1   a  and data not shown). In addition, the results obtained on studying HBsAg-specific and HIV 1-Gag-specific T cell responses of these mice were all indicative of exclusive usage of the HLA-A2.1 and HLA-DR1 molecules as restricting elements. This argues that the unconventional HLA-DR\\u03b1/H-2 IE\\u03b2 b  hybrids were likely unstable compared to conventional HLA-DR\\u03b1/HLA-DR\\u03b2 molecules and that they may exist only in the absence of the HLA-DR\\u03b2 chain. Mouse strains in which the entire (H-2 IA\\u03b2 b , IA\\u03b1 b , IE\\u03b2 b ) H-2 class II region has been deleted (Madsen, L. et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  96, 10338-10343 (1999)), as well as the H-2 D b  gene, are being analyzed to completely exclude this possibility. Preliminary analysis of splenocytes obtained from the first animals revealed a CD4 +  T cell pool restoration similar to that observed in HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class II-KO (Ia\\u03b2 b\\u00b0 ) mice, suggesting that the HLA-DR1-restricted CD4 +  T cell responses of these new mice should be equivalent to those of the HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice.  \\n      The peripheral CD8 +  T lymphocytes of HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice, compared to parental HLA-A2.1-transgenic H-2 class I-KO mice, are quantitatively and qualitatively similar with full diversification, at least in terms of BV segment usage, of the TCR repertoire. Partial restoration compared to wild-type animals, especially of the CD8 +  T cell pool, has been a constant observation in single HLA-transgenic mice expressing a chimeric (\\u03b13 domain of mouse origin) HLA-A2.1 molecule (Pascolo, S. et al.,  J Exp Med  185, 2043-2051 (1997)). Regardless of the \\u03b13 domain substitution, the interaction remains suboptimal between mouse CD8 and HLA-A2.1 molecules, since co-crystal analysis has documented that human CD8 also contacts the HLA-A2.1 heavy chain \\u03b12 domain (Gao, G. F. et al.,  Nature  387, 630-634 (1997)). Suboptimal cooperation might also occur in the endoplasmic reticulum where many molecules (TAP, tapasine, ERp 57) assist MHC class I molecule biosynthesis. However, at this stage, the only documented functional difference between these mice and human endoplasmic reticulum molecules, namely the efficient transport by human but not mouse TAP of COOH-terminus positively charged cytosolic peptides (Momburg, F., Neefjes, J. J. &amp; Hammerling, G. J.,  Curr Opin Immunol  6, 32-37 (1994)), is not relevant for HLA-A2.1 molecules which bind peptides with a hydrophobic C-terminus, since these peptides are transported efficiently by mouse and human TAP. Even though the number of CD8 +  T lymphocytes is lower in both single HLA-A2.1-transgenic, H-2 class I-KO mice and in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice, they respond efficiently against HBsAg and, importantly, the latter mice develop antibody, helper and cytolytic cell responses similar to humans.  \\n      One of the difficulties hampering the design of T-epitope-based vaccines targeting T lymphocytes is HLA class I/class II molecule polymorphism. HLA-A2.1 and HLA-DR1 molecules are expressed by a significant proportion of individuals in human populations (30 to 50% for HLA-A2.1, 6 to 18% for HLA-DR1). Even though the functional clustering of HLA class I molecules in superfamilies is based on significant redundancy of the presented sets of peptides 34 , individual analysis of the responses elicited by each HLA class I isotypic or allelic variant remains desirable to identify the optimal epitopes they present. This is particularly important to devise a new reagent, such as tetramer (HLA-class I or HLA-class II) to monitor the immune response. For the same reason, it would be helpful to obtain strains of mice co-expressing HLA-A2.1 with other HLA class II molecules, even if the binding of peptides to HLA class II molecules is less restrictive than to class I molecules. Based on the disclosure herein, additional HLA class I-/class II-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice can be constructed for these and other purposes.  \\n      Whereas HLA-transgenic H-2-KO mice enable a detailed analysis and optimization of the immunogenicity of antigenic peptides with excellent transposability to humans (Rohrlich, P. S. et al.,  Int Immunol  15, 765-772 (2003); Loirat, D., Lemonnier, F. A. &amp; Michel, M. L.,  J Immunol  165, 4748-4755 (2000); Scardino, A. et al.,  Eur J Immunol  31, 3261-3270 (2001)) this is less evident for vaccine adjuvant-formulation studies. This could be due to differences between the two species in the various effectors that are mobilized early in response to an antigenic challenge. Increasing fundamental knowledge of innate immunity might, in the future, lead to a more complete humanization of the mouse immune system.  \\n      In conclusion, the disclosure herein describes an optimized, humanized transgenic mouse model, whose H-2 class I (mouse \\u03b22m) and class II (H-2 IA\\u03b2 b ) genes have been deleted and replaced with equivalent human genes HHD (HLA-A*0201), HLA-DRA*0101 and HLA-DRB1*0101. Cellular immunity in the HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice is completely restricted by the human HLA molecules, with a complete absence of immune responses restricted by the murine MHC molecules. The absence of competition between murine MHC and human (transgenic) HLA immune responses allows for use of these mice to characterize epitopes in human vaccines that require collaboration between HLA-restricted CD4 +  T helper and HLA-restricted CD8 +  T cytolytic cells.  \\n      \\u201cHLA\\u201d is the human MHC complex, and \\u201cH-2\\u201d the mouse MHC complex. The human complex comprises three class I a-chain genes, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three pairs of MHC class II \\u03b1- and \\u03b2-chain genes, HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ. In many haplotypes, the HLA-DR cluster contains an extra \\u03b2-chain gene whose product can pair with the DR\\u03b1 chain, and so the three sets of genes give rise to four types of MHC class II molecules. In the mouse, the three class I a-chain genes are H-2-L, H-2-D, and H-2-K. The mouse MHC class II genes are H-2-A and H-2-E.  \\n      It is known in the art that genetic diversity exists between the HLA genes of different individuals as a result of both polymorphic HLA antigens and distinct HLA alleles. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention disclosed herein may substitute one polymorphic HLA antigen for another or one HLA allele for another. Examples of HLA polymorphisms and alleles can be found, for example, at http://www.anthonynolan.org.uk/HIG/data.html and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla, and in Genetic diversity of HLA: Functional and Medical Implication, Dominique Charon (Ed.), EDK Medical and Scientific International Publisher, and The HLA FactsBook, Steven G. E. Marsh, Peter Parham and Linda Barber, AP Academic Press, 2000.  \\n      A \\u201cdisrupted\\u201d gene is one that has been mutated using homologous recombination or other approaches known in the art. A disrupted gene can be either a hypomorphic allele of the gene or a null allele of the gene. One of skill in the art will recognize that the type of allele to be used can be selected for any particular context. In many embodiments of the invention, a null allele is preferred.  \\n      \\u201cHomologous recombination\\u201d is a general approach for targeting mutations to a preselected, desired gene sequence of a cell in order to produce a transgenic animal (Mansour, S. L. et al., Nature 336:348-352 (1988); Capecchi, M. R.,  Trends Genet.  5:70-76 (1989); Capecchi, M. R.,  Science  244:1288-1292 (1989); Capecchi, M. R. et al., In: Current Communications in Molecular Biology, Capecchi, M. R. (ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), pp. 45-52; Frohman, M. A. et al.,  Cell  56:145-147 (1989)).  \\n      It is now be feasible to deliberately alter any gene in a mouse (Capecchi, M. R.,  Trends Genet.  5:70-76 (1989); Frohman, M. A. et al.,  Cell  56:145-147 (1989)). Gene targeting involves the use of standard recombinant DNA techniques to introduce a desired mutation into a cloned DNA sequence of a chosen locus. That mutation is then transferred through homologous recombination to the genome of a pluripotent, embryo-derived stem (ES) cell. The altered stem cells are microinjected into mouse blastocysts and are incorporated into the developing mouse embryo to ultimately develop into chimeric animals. In some cases, germ line cells of the chimeric animals will be derived from the genetically altered ES cells, and the mutant genotypes can be transmitted through breeding.  \\n      Gene targeting has been used to produce chimeric and transgenic mice in which an nptII gene has been inserted into the \\u03b2 2 -microglobulin locus (Koller, B. H. et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.  ( U.S.A. ) 86:8932-8935 (1989); Zijlstra, M. et al.,  Nature  342:435-438 (1989); Zijlstra, M. et al.,  Nature  344:742-746 (1989); DeChiaba et al.,  Nature  345:78-80 (1990)). Similar experiments have enabled the production of chimeric and transgenic animals having a c-abI gene which has been disrupted by the insertion of an nptil gene (Schwartzberg, P. L. et al.,  Science  246:799-803 (1989)). The technique has been used to produce chimeric mice in which the en-2 gene has been disrupted by the insertion of an nptII gene (Joyner, A. L. et al.,  Nature  338:153-155 (1989)).  \\n      In order to utilize the \\u201cgene targeting\\u201d method, the gene of interest must have been previously cloned, and the intron-exon boundaries determined. The method results in the insertion of a marker gene (e.g., an nptil gene) into a translated region of a particular gene of interest. Thus, use of the gene targeting method results in the gross destruction of the gene of interest.  \\n      Significantly, the use of gene targeting to alter a gene of a cell results in the formation of a gross alteration in the sequence of that gene. The efficiency of gene targeting depends upon a number of variables, and is different from construct to construct.  \\n      The chimeric or transgenic animal cells of the present invention are prepared by introducing one or more DNA molecules into a cell, which may be a precursor pluripotent cell, such as an ES cell, or equivalent (Robertson, E. J., In: Current Communications in Molecular Biology, Capecchi, M. R. (ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), pp. 39-44). The term \\u201cprecursor\\u201d is intended to denote only that the pluripotent cell is a precursor to the desired (\\u201ctransfected\\u201d) pluripotent cell, which is prepared in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The pluripotent (precursor or transfected) cell can be cultured in vivo in a manner known in the art (Evans, M. J. et al., Nature 292:154-156 (1981)) to form a chimeric or transgenic animal.  \\n      Any ES cell can be used in accordance with the present invention. It is, however, preferred to use primary isolates of ES cells. Such isolates can be obtained directly from embryos, such as the CCE cell line disclosed by Robertson, E. J., In: Current Communications in Molecular Biology, Capecchi, M. R. (ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), pp. 39-44), or from the clonal isolation of ES cells from the CCE cell line (Schwartzberg, P. A. et al., Science 246:799-803 (1989), which reference is incorporated herein by reference). Such clonal isolation can be accomplished according to the method of E. J. Robertson (In: Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, (E. J. Robertson, Ed.), IRL Press, Oxford, 1987), which reference and method are incorporated herein by reference. The purpose of such clonal propagation is to obtain ES cells, which have a greater efficiency for differentiating into an animal. Clonally selected ES cells are approximately 10-fold more effective in producing transgenic animals than the progenitor cell line CCE. For the purposes of the recombination methods of the present invention, clonal selection provides no advantage.  \\n      An example of ES cell lines, which have been clonally derived from embryos, are the ES cell lines, AB1 (hprt + ) or AB2.1 (hprt \\u2212 ). The ES cells are preferably cultured on stromal cells (such as STO cells (especially SNC4 STO cells) and/or primary embryonic fibroblast cells) as described by E. J. Robertson (In: Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, (E. J. Robertson, Ed., IRL Press, Oxford, 1987, pp 71-112), which reference is incorporated herein by reference. Methods for the production and analysis of chimeric mice are disclosed by Bradley, A. (In: Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, (E. J. Robertson, Ed.), IRL Press, Oxford, 1987, pp 113-151), which reference is incorporated herein by reference. The stromal (and/or fibroblast) cells serve to eliminate the clonal overgrowth of abnormal ES cells. Most preferably, the cells are cultured in the presence of leukocyte inhibitory factor (\\u201cIif\\u201d) (Gough, N. M. et al.,  Reprod. Fertil. Dev.  1:281-288 (1989); Yamamori, Y. et al.,  Science  246:1412-1416 (1989), both of which references are incorporated herein by reference). Since the gene encoding Iif has been cloned (Gough, N. M. et al.,  Reprod. Fertil. Dev.  1:281-288 (1989)), it is especially preferred to transform stromal cells with this gene, by means known in the art, and to then culture the ES cells on transformed stromal cells that secrete Iif into the culture medium.  \\n      As used herein, the term \\u201ctransgene\\u201d refers to a nucleic acid sequence, which is partly or entirely heterologous, i.e., foreign, to the transgenic animal or cell into which it is introduced, or, is homologous to an endogenous gene of the transgenic animal or cell into which it is introduced, but which is designed to be inserted, or is inserted, into the animal&#39;s genome in such a way as to alter the genome of the cell into which it is inserted (e.g., it is inserted at a location which differs from that of the natural gene or its insertion results in a knockout). A transgene can be operably linked to one or more transcriptional regulatory sequences and any other nucleic acid, such as introns, that may be necessary for optimal expression of a selected nucleic acid. Exemplary transgenes of the present invention encode, for instance an H-2 polypeptide. Other exemplary transgenes are directed to disrupting one or more HLA genes by homologous recombination with genomic sequences of an HLA gene.  \\n      A \\u201cfunctional transgene\\u201d is one that produces an mRNA transcript, which in turn produces a properly processed protein in at least one cell of the mouse comprising the transgene. One of skill will realize that the diverse set of known transcriptional regulatory elements and sequences directing posttranscriptional processing provide a library of options from which to direct the expression of a transgene is a host mouse. In many embodiments of the invention, expression of an HLA transgene under the control of an H-2 gene regulatory element may be preferred.  \\n      In some embodiments, the HLA class I transgene is an HLA-A2 transgene and the HLA class II transgene is an HLA-DR1 transgene. An example of an HLA-A2 transgene is one that comprises the HLA-A2 sequence provided in the sequence listing. An example of an HLA-DR1 transgene is one that comprises the HLA-DR1 sequence provided in the sequence listing.  \\n      In an embodiment, the invention provides a transgenic mouse deficient for both H2 class I and class II molecules, wherein the transgenic mouse comprises a functional HLA class I transgene and a functional HLA class II transgene. In some embodiments, the mouse has the genotype HLA-A2 + HLA-DR1 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0IA\\u03b2\\u00b0. In other embodiments the HLA-A2 transgene comprises the HLA-A2 sequence provided in the sequence listing and the HLA-DR1 transgene comprises the HLA-DR1 sequence provided in the sequence listing.  \\n      The invention also provides isolated transgenic mouse cells. In some cases the cell comprises a disrupted H2 class I gene, a disrupted H2 class II gene, and a functional HLA class I or class II transgene. In others, the cell comprises a disrupted H2 class I gene, a disrupted H2 class II gene, a functional HLA class I transgene, and a functional HLA class II transgene. The HLA class I transgene can be an HLA-A2 transgene and the HLA class II transgene can be an HLA-DR1 transgene. In some cases, the HLA-A2 transgene comprises the HLA-A2 sequence provided in the sequence listing and the HLA-DR1 transgene comprises the HLA-DR1 sequence provided in the sequence listing.  \\n      In an embodiment, the invention provides an isolated transgenic mouse cell deficient for both H2 class I and class II molecules, wherein the transgenic mouse comprises a functional HLA class I transgene and a functional HLA class II transgene. The isolated transgenic mouse cells can have the genotype HLA-A2 + HLA-DR1 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0IA\\u03b2\\u00b0. The HLA-A2 transgene can comprise the HLA-A2 sequence provided in the sequence listing and the HLA-DR1 transgene can comprise the HLA-DR1 sequence provided in the sequence listing.  \\n      The isolated transgenic mouse cells of the invention can have the genotype of any mouse of the invention. However, the set of genotypes of the isolated transgenic mouse cells of the invention, and the set of genotypes of the mice of the invention are not necessarily entirely overlapping.  \\n      The isolated mouse cells of the invention can be obtained from a mouse or mouse embryo. In one embodiment, the mouse or mouse embryo has the same genotype as the cell to be obtained. In another embodiment, the mouse or mouse embryo has a different genotype than the cell to be obtained. After the cell is obtained from the mouse or mouse embryo, a gene of the cell can be disrupted by, for example, homologous recombination. Additionally, a functional transgene can be introduced into the genome of the cell by, for example, transfection. One of skill in the art will recognize that any suitable method known in the art can be applied to modify the genome of the cell to thereby obtain an isolated mouse cell having the desired genotype.  \\n      An additional object of the invention is an isolated transgenic mouse cell deficient for both H2 class I and class II molecules, wherein the transgenic mouse cell comprises a functional HLA class I transgene and a functional HLA class II transgene. In some embodiments, the transgenic mouse cell has the genotype HLA-A2 + HLA-DR1 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0IA\\u03b2\\u00b0. In other embodiments, the HLA-A2 transgene comprises the HLA-A2 sequence provided in the sequence listing and the HLA-DR1 transgene comprises the HLA-DR1 sequence provided in the sequence listing.  \\n      T cells play a central role in many aspects of acquired immunity, carrying out a variety of regulatory and defensive functions. When some T cells encounter an infected or cancerous cell, they recognize it as foreign and respond by acting as killer cells, killing the host&#39;s own cells as part of the cell-mediated immune response. Other T cells, designated helper T cells, respond to perceived foreign antigens by stimulating B cells to produce antibodies, or by suppressing certain aspects of a humoral or cellular immune response.  \\n      T helper cells (Th) orchestrate much of the immune response via the production of cytokines. Although generally identifiable as bearing the CD4 cell surface marker, these cells are functionally divided into Th1 or Th2 subpopulations according to the profile of cytokines they produce and their effect on other cells of the immune system.  \\n      The Th1 cells detect invading pathogens or cancerous host cells through a recognition system referred to as the T cell antigen receptor. Termed cellular immunity, Th1-related processes generally involve the activation of non-B cells and are frequently characterized by the production of IFN-\\u03b3. Nevertheless, although the Th1 system is primarily independent from the production of humoral antibodies, Th1 cytokines do promote immunoglobulin class switching to the IgG 2a  isotype.  \\n      Upon detection of a foreign antigen, most mature Th1 cells direct the release of IL-2, IL-3, IFN-\\u03b3, TNF-\\u03b2, GM-CSF, high levels of TNF-\\u03b1, MIP-1\\u03b1, MIP-1\\u03b2, and RANTES. These cytokines promote delayed-type hypersensitivity and general cell-mediated immunity. IL-2, for instance, is a T cell growth factor that promotes the production of a clone of additional T cells sensitive to the particular antigen that was initially detected. The sensitized T cells attach to and attack cells or pathogens containing the antigen.  \\n      In contrast, mature Th2 cells tend to promote the secretion of IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, GM-CSF, and low levels of TNF-\\u03b1. In addition, the Th2 response promotes humoral immunity by activating B cells, stimulating antibody production and secretion, and inducing class switching to IgA, IgG, and IgE isotypes.  \\n      As used herein, an \\u201cantigen\\u201d comprises: 1) at least one HTL epitope, or 2) at least one CTL epitope or, 3) at least one B cell epitope, or 4) at least one HTL epitope and at least one CTL epitope, or 5) at least one HTL epitope and at least one B cell epitope, or 6) at least one CTL epitope and at least one B cell epitope, or 7) at least one HTL epitope and at least one CTL epitope and at least one B cell epitope. A \\u201ccandidate antigen\\u201d is a molecule that is under investigation to determine whether it functions as an antigen.  \\n      A \\u201chumoral immune response\\u201d is antibody-mediated specific immunity.  \\n      An \\u201cepitope\\u201d is a site on an antigen that is recognized by the immune system. An antibody epitope is a site on an antigen recognized by an antibody. A T-cell epitope is a site on an antigen that binds to an MHC molecule. A TH epitope is one that binds to an MHC class II molecule. A CTL epitope is one that binds to an MHC class I molecule.  \\n      The antigen can comprise a polypeptide sequence or a polynucleotide sequence, which can comprise RNA, DNA, or both. In one embodiment, the antigen comprises at least one polynucleotide sequence operationally encoding one or more antigenic polypeptides. Used in this context, the word \\u201ccomprises\\u201d intends that at least one antigenic polypeptide is provided by the transcription and/or translation apparatus of a host cell acting upon an exogenous polynucleotide that encodes at least one antigenic polypeptide, as described, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,389 and 6,214,808.  \\n      Antigens of the invention can be any antigenic molecule. Antigenic molecules include: proteins, lipoproteins, and glycoproteins, including viral, bacterial, parasitic, animal, and fungal proteins such as albumins, tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, pertussis toxoid, bacterial outer membrane proteins (including meningococcal outer membrane protein), RSV-F protein, malarial derived peptide, B-lactoglobulin B, aprotinin, ovalbumin, lysozyme, and tumor associated antigens such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 15-3, CA 125, CA 19-9, prostrate specific antigen (PSA), and the TM complexes of U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,556, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; carbohydrates, including naturally-occurring and synthetic polysaccharides and other polymers such as ficoll, dextran, carboxymethyl cellulose, agarose, polyacrylamide and other acrylic resins, poly (lactide-co-glycolide), polyvinyl alcohol, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylpryrolidine, Group B Steptococcal and Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (including type III),  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  mucoexopolysaccharide, and capsular polysaccharides (including fisher type I), and  Haemophilus influenzae  polysaccharides (including PRP); haptens, and other moieties comprising low molecular weight molecules, such as TNP, saccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, peptides, toxins, drugs, chemicals, and allergens; and haptens and antigens derived from bacteria, rickettsiae, fungi, viruses, parasites, including Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus,  H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, E.

Any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be employed for administration of the composition. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington&#39;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (A. Gennaro, ed., 1990) Mack Pub., Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water, polyethylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), oils, including petroleum oil, animal oil, vegetable oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Carriers can be in the form of mists, sprays, powders, waxes, creams, suppositories, implants, salves, ointments, patches, poultices, films, or cosmetic preparations.  \\n      Proper formulation of the pharmaceutical composition or vaccine is dependent on the route of administration chosen. For example, with intravenous administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion, the compositions are preferably water soluble, and saline is a preferred carrier. For transcutaneous, intranasal, oral, gastric, intravaginal, intrarectal, or other transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated can be included in the formulation and are known in the art. For oral administration, the active ingredient can be combined with carriers suitable for inclusion into tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like. Time-sensitive delivery systems are also applicable for the administration of the compositions of the invention. Representative systems include polymer base systems, such as poly(lactide-glycoside), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid and polyanhydrides. These and like polymers can be formulated into microcapsules according to methods known in the art, for example, as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,109, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternative delivery systems appropriate for the administration of the disclosed immunostimulatory compounds of the invention include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,389, 6,024,983 5,817,637, 6,228,621, 5,804,212, 5,709,879, 5,703,055, 5,643,605, 5,643,574, 5,580,563, 5,239,660, 5,204,253, 4,748,043, 4,667,014, 4,452,775, 3,854,480, and 3,832,252 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).  \\n      Aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable or aerosol solutions. For administration by aerosol, as by pressurized spray or nebulizer, suitable propellants can be added as understood by those familiar with the art. The immunological composition can also be formulated with solubilizing agents; emulsifiers; stabilizers; dispersants; flavorants; adjuvants; carriers; topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine, xylocaine, and the like; antibiotics; and known or suspected anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, or anti-tumor compounds.  \\n      An \\u201cadjuvant\\u201d is a composition that promotes or enhances an immune response to a target antigen. One of skill in the art can select an appropriate adjuvant for use in practicing the present invention in view of the disclosure herein.  \\n      The present invention encompasses methods of treating a patient in need of immune stimulation by administering a composition comprising one or more antigens of the invention. As used herein, treatment encompasses corrective, restorative, ameliorative, and preventive methods relating to any disease, condition, abnormality, or symptom. Treatment further encompasses the elicitation or suppression of an immune response in an experimental animal or ex vivo.  \\n      Thus, treatment comprises administering an immunostimulatory amount of any of the immunostimulatory compositions of the invention by any method familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art, commonly including oral and intranasal routes, and intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injections, but also encompassing, intraperitoneal, intracorporeal, intra-articular, intraventricular, intrathecal, topical, tonsillar, mucosal, transdermal, intravaginal administration and by gavage.  \\n      As is recognized by the skilled practitioner, choosing an appropriate administration method may contribute to the efficacy of a treatment, and local administration may be preferred for some applications. Acceptable routes of local administration include subcutaneous, intradermal, intraperitoneal, intravitreal, inhalation or lavage, oral, intranasal, and directed injection into a predetermined tissue, organ, joint, tumor, or cell mass. For example, mucosal application or injection into mucosal lymph nodes or Peyer&#39;s patches may promote a humoral immune response with substantial IgA class switching. Alternatively, targeted injection into a lesion, focus, or affected body site may be applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, localized infections, or other situs requiring immune stimulation.  \\n      Alternatively, cells of the immune system (e.g., T cells, B cells, NK cells, or oligodendrocytes) can be removed from a host and treated in vitro. The treated cells can be further cultured or reintroduced to a patient (or to a heterologous host) to provide immune stimulation to the patient or host. For example, bone marrow cells can be aspirated from a patient and treated with an HDR to stimulate global or specific immunity. High-dose radiation, or comparable treatments, can then be used to destroy the remaining immune cells in the patient. Upon re-implantation, the autologous stimulated cells will restore normal immune function in the patient. Alternatively, NK and/or T cells isolated from a patient suffering from cancer may be exposed in vitro to one or more antigens specific to the patient&#39;s cancer. Upon re-implantation into the patient, the antigen-stimulated cells will deploy a vigorous cellular immune response against the cancerous cells.  \\n      An immunostimulatory (efficacious) amount refers to that amount of vaccine that is able to stimulate an immune response in a patient, which is sufficient to prevent, ameliorate, or otherwise treat a pathogenic challenge, allergy, or immunologic abnormality or condition. An immunostimulatory amount is that amount, which provides a measurable increase in a humoral or cellular immune response to at least one epitope of the antigen as compared to the response obtained if the antigen is administered to the patient without prior treatment with the vaccine. Thus, for example, an immunostimulatory amount refers to that amount of an antigen-containing composition that is able to promote the production of antibodies directed against an antigenic epitope of interest or stimulate a detectable protective effect against a pathogenic or allergenic challenge or to promote a protective CTL response against an antigenic epitope of interest.  \\n      Treatment with an immunostimulatory amount of an antigen-containing composition of the invention comprises effecting any directly, indirectly, or statistically observable or measurable increase or other desired change in the immune response in a host, specifically including an ex vivo tissue culture host, comprising at least one cell of the immune system or cell line derived therefrom. Host cells can be derived from human or animal peripheral blood, lymph nodes or the like. Preferred tissue culture hosts include freshly isolated T cells, B cells, macrophages, oligodendrocytes, NK cells, and monocytes, each of which can be isolated or purified using standard techniques. Observable or measurable responses include, B or T cell proliferation or activation; increased antibody secretion; isotype switching; increased cytokine release, particularly the increased release of one or more of IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFN-\\u03b3, TNF-\\u03b1, TNF-\\u03b2, GM-CSF, MIP-1\\u03b1, MIP-1\\u03b2, or RANTES; increased antibody titer or avidity against a specific antigen; reduced morbidity or mortality rates associated with a pathogenic infection; promoting, inducing, maintaining, or reinforcing viral latency; suppressing or otherwise ameliorating the growth, metastasis, or effects of malignant and non-malignant tumors; and providing prophylactic protection from a disease or the effects of a disease.  \\n      Where the suppression of an immunological response is desired, for example, in the treatment of autoimmune disease or allergy, an effective amount also encompasses that amount sufficient to effect a measurable or observable decrease in a response associated with the condition or pathology to be treated.  \\n      The amount of an antigen-containing composition to be administered and the frequency of administration can be determined empirically and will take into consideration the age and size of the patient being treated, and the condition or disease to be addressed. An appropriate dose is within the range of 0.01 \\u03bcg to 100 \\u03bcg per inoculum, but higher and lower amounts may also be indicated. Secondary booster immunizations can be given at intervals ranging from one week to many months later.  \\n      The following examples demonstrate certain embodiments of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the numerous modifications and variations that may be performed without altering the spirit or scope of the present invention. Such modifications and variations are believed to be encompassed within the scope of the invention. The examples do not in any way limit the invention.  \\n     EXAMPLES  \\n      The following experimental techniques and reagents were used to demonstrate certain nonlimiting embodiments of the invention.  \\n      Transgenic Mice  \\n      The HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class II-KO (IA \\u03b2 b\\u00b0 ) mice were obtained at the Institut Pasteur of Lille by crossing HLA-DR1-transgenic mice (Altmann, D. M. et al., J Exp Med 181, 867-875 (1995)) with H-2 class II-KO (IA \\u03b2 b\\u00b0 ) mice (Rohrlich, P. S. et al.,  Int Immunol  15, 765-772 (2003)). The HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice, expressing a chimeric monochain (HHD molecule: \\u03b11-\\u03b12 domains of HLA-A2.1, \\u03b13 to cytoplasmic domains of H-2 D b , linked at its N-terminus to the C terminus of human \\u03b22m by a 15 amino-acid peptide linker) were created (Pascolo, S. et al.,  J Exp Med  185, 2043-2051 (1997)). HLA-A2.1 (HHD)-transgenic H-2 class I-KO and HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class II-KO (IA \\u03b2 b\\u00b0 ) mice were intercrossed and progenies screened until HLA-A2.1 \\u00b1 /HLA-DR1 \\u00b1  double transgenic H-2-class I (\\u03b22m 0 )-/class II (IA\\u03b2 0 )-KO animals were obtained and used for the experiments described herein. HLA-A2.1 \\u00b1  single transgenic H-2-class I (\\u03b22m 0 )-/class II (IA\\u03b2 0 )-KO mice were used as controls in the protection assays. Mice were bred in the animal facilities at the Institut Pasteur, Paris; all protocols were reviewed by the Institut Pasteur competent authority for compliance with the French and European regulations on Animal Welfare and with Public Health Service recommendations.  \\n      Genotyping  \\n      The HLA-DRB1*0101, HLA-DRA*0101 and HLA-A*0201 transgenes were detected by PCR. Tail-DNA was extracted after overnight incubation at 56\\u00b0 C. in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 100 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by the addition of 250 \\u03bcl of saturated NaCl solution and isopropanol precipitation. The samples were washed (3\\u00d7) in 70% ethanol and resuspended in 150 \\u03bcl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8. PCR conditions were: 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.25 U of Taq Polymerase, buffer supplied by the manufacturer (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 1 cycle (7 min, 94\\u00b0 C.), 40 cycles (30 sec, 94\\u00b0 C.; 30 sec, 60\\u00b0 C.; 1 min, 72\\u00b0 C.), 1 cycle (4 min, 72\\u00b0 C.), using as forward and reverse primers, for HHD: 5\\u2032CAT TGA GAC AGA GCG CTT GGC ACA GAA GCA G 3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032GGA TGA CGT GAG TM ACC TGA ATC UTT GGA GTA CGC 3\\u2032, for HLA-DRB1*0101: 5\\u2032 TTC TTC AAC GGG ACG GAG CGG GTG 3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032 CTG CAC TGT GM GCT CTC ACC MC 3\\u2032, and for HLA-DRA*0101: 5\\u2032 CTC CAA GCC CTC TCC CAG AG 3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032 ATG TGC CTT ACA GAG GCC CC 3\\u2032.  \\n      FACS Analysis  \\n      Cytofluorimetry studies were performed on red-blood cell-depleted, Lympholyte M-purified (Tebu-bio, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) splenocytes using FITC-conjugated W6/32 (anti-HLA-ABC, Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) and biotinilated anti-28-8-6S (anti-H-2 K b /D b , BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif.) m.Ab. CD4 +  and CD8 +  T lymphocytes were stained using PE-labeled CT-CD4 anti-mouse CD4 (CALTAG, South San Francisco, Calif.) and FITC-labeled 53-6.7 anti-mouse CD8 m.Ab (BD Biosciences). Analysis of MHC class II molecule expression was performed on B220 +  B lymphocytes positively selected on MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Following saturation of Fc receptors with 2.4G2 m.Ab, expression of HLA-DR1 and H-2 IA b  was analyzed using FITC-labeled L243 (anti-HLA-DR) and PE-labeled AF6-120.1 (anti-H-2 IA\\u03b2 b ) m.Ab (BD Biosciences). Paraformaldehyde fixed cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, Mass.).  \\n      Immunoscope Analyses  \\n      CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cells from naive mice were positively selected on Auto-Macs (Miltenyi Biotec), RNA prepared using RNA Easy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used for cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was PCR-amplified using forward primers specific for each BV segment family and a reverse primer shared by the two BC segments. PCR-products were subjected to a run-off-elongation with internal BC FAM-tagged primer. The run-off products were loaded on a 6% acrylamide/8 M urea gel for separation (7 h, 35 W) with a 373A DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystem, Foster City, Calif.). Data were analyzed using immunoscope software (Pannetier, C. et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  90, 4319-4323 (1993)).  \\n      Peptides  \\n      The HLA-A2 binding peptides HBsAg 348-357  GLSPTVWLSV and HBsAg 335-343  WLSLLVPFV, the H-2 K b  binding peptide HBsAg 371-378  ILSPFLPL, the HLA-DR1 binding peptide HBsAg 180-195  QAGFFLLTRILTIPQS, the H-2 IA b  binding peptide HBsAg 126-138  RGLYFPAGGSSSG and the preS2 peptide HBsAg 109-134  MQWNSTTFHQTLQDPRVRGLYFPAGG were synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) and dissolved in PBS-10% DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The numbering of the amino acid sequence of peptides starts from the first methionine of the HBV ayw subtype preS1 domain.  \\n      Immunization with DNA Encoding the S2-S Proteins of HBV  \\n      The pCMV-S2.S plasmid vector (Michel, M. L. et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  92, 5307-5311 (1995)) coding for the preS2 and the S HBV surface antigens expressed under the control of the human CMV immediate early gene promotor was purified on Plasmid Giga Kit columns under endotoxin free conditions (Qiagen). Anesthesized mice were injected (50 \\u03bcg each side) into regenerating tibialis anterior muscles, as previously described (Davis, H. L., Michel, M. L. &amp; Whalen, R. G.,  Hum Mol Genet  2, 1847-1851 (1993)).  \\n      T Cell Proliferation Assay  \\n      Twelve days after the last immunization, red-blood cell-depleted, Ficoll-purified splenocytes (5.10 6  cells/25 cm 2  culture flask (Techno Plastic Products (TPP), Trasadingen, Switzerland)) were co-cultured with peptide-pulsed (20 \\u03bcg/ml), \\u03b3-irradiated (180 Gy) LPS-blasts (5.10 6  cells/ culture flask) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5\\u00d710 \\u22125  M 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 I.U/ml penicillin and 100 \\u03bcg streptomycin, as described (Loirat, D., Lemonnier, F. A. &amp; Michel, M. L.,  J Immunol  165, 4748-4755 (2000)). On day 7, for proliferation assays, cells were plated (5\\u00d710 5  cells/well of flat bottomed 96 well microplates, (TPP)) with peptide-pulsed irradiated LPS-Blasts (2\\u00d710 5  cells/well) for 72 h in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 3% FCS. Cells were pulsed for the final 16 h with 1 \\u03bcCi of ( 3 H)-thymidine per well before being harvested on filtermates with a TOMTEC collector (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystem), and incorporated radioactivity was measured on a micro-\\u03b2 counter (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystem). Results are given as stimulation index (SI)=cpm with specific peptide/cpm with irrelevant peptide.  \\n      Measurement of CTL Activity  \\n      Cytotoxicity assays were performed on the same immune splenocyte populations as the proliferation assays. Responder cells (5.10 6  cells/25 cm 2  culture flask, TPP) and stimulating peptide-pulsed (20 \\u03bcg/ml), \\u03b3-irradiated (180 Gy) LPS-blasts (5.10 6  cells/ culture flask) were co-cultured for 7 days in the same supplemented RPMI medium as for proliferation assays. Cytolytic activity was tested in a standard 4 h  51 Cr assay against RMA-S HHD target cells pulsed with 10 \\u03bcg/ml of the experimental or control peptides. Specific lysis, in %, was calculated in duplicates, according to: \\n \\n[experimental\\u2212spontaneous release]/[maximal\\u2212spontaneous release]\\u00d7100, substracting the non-specific lysis observed with the control peptide. \\n \\n      Measurement of in vivo Antibody Production  \\n      At various times before and after DNA injection, blood was collected from mice by retrobulbar puncture with heparinized glass pipettes, and sera recovered by centrifugation were assayed for anti-HBs and anti-preS2 by specific ELISA. Purified recombinant particles containing HBV small S protein (1 ug/ml) or preS2 (120-145) synthetic peptide (1 ug/ml) were used as the solid phase. After blocking with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 10% FCS, serial dilutions were added. After extensive washing, the bound antibodies were detected with anti mouse Ig (total IgG) labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). Antibody titers were determined by the serial end-point dilution method. Mouse sera were tested individually, and titers were the mean of at least three determinations. Serum dilutions below 1/100 were considered negative.  \\n      Antibody Titration  \\n      Sera from immunized mice were individually assayed by ELISA (Michel, M. L. et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  92, 5307-5311 (1995)) on either purified HBV middle and small proteins or preS2 synthetic HBs 109-134 . peptide, After blocking with PBS 1\\u00d7 supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 10% FCS and washings (\\u00d73), bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). Antibody titers (means of at least 3 determinations) were determined by the serial end-point dilution method. Titers below 1/100 were considered negative.  \\n      Vaccinia Challenge and Plaque Assay  \\n      DNA-injected mice were challenged intraperitoneally 12 days post last injection with 10 7  PFU of recombinant vaccinia virus (Western Reserve strain) expressing either the HbsAg (Smith, G. L., Mackett, M. &amp; Moss, B.,  Nature  302, 490-495 (1983)) or the HBx protein (Schek, N., Bartenschlager, R., Kuhn, C. &amp; Schaller, H.,  Oncogene  6, 1735-1744. (1991)) kindly provided, respectively, by Dr B. Moss and Dr H. Schaller. Four days later, ovaries were assayed for rVV titers by plaque assay on BHK 21 cells (Buller, R. M. &amp; Wallace, G. D.,  Lab Anim Sci  35, 473-476 (1985).  \\n     Example 1  \\n     Cell Surface Expression of MHC Molecules  \\n      Cell surface expression of the HLA-A2.1, H-2 K b /D b , HLA-DR1, and H-2 IA b  molecules was evaluated on splenocytes by flow cytometry. As illustrated in  FIG. 1   a,  a similar level of HLA-A2.1 expression was observed in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice and HLA-A2.1-transgenic, H-2 class I-KO mice, while HLA-A2.1 was absent and H-2 K b /D b  expressed exclusively in HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class II-KO mice. Cell surface expression of HLA-DR1 and H-2 IA b  was measured on B220 + -enriched B cells. As shown in  FIG. 1   b,  a similar level of HLA-DR1 expression was observed in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice and HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class II-KO mice, whereas no expression was detected in HLA-A2.1-transgenic, H-2 class I-KO mice. Cell surface expression of the transgenic molecules (especially HLA-DR1) was, however, lower than the expression of endogenous H-2 class I and class II molecules.  \\n     Example 2  \\n     Peripheral CD4 +  and CD8 +  T Cells  \\n      CD4 +  and CD8 +  splenic T cell numbers were determined by immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis as illustrated in  FIG. 2   a.    \\n      CD4 +  T cells represented 13-14% of the splenocyte population in both HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice and HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class II-KO mice. In contrast, only 2-3% of the cells were CD4 +  in H-2 class II-KO mice (data not shown), in agreement with the initial report on mice lacking MHC class II molecules (Cosgrove, D. et al.,  Cell  66, 1051-1066 (1991)). As expected, expression of transgenic HLA-A2.1 molecules led to an increase in the size of the peripheral CD8 +  T cell population, which reached 2-3% of the total splenocytes in both HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice and HLA-A2.1-transgenic, H-2 class I-KO mice, compared to 0.6-1% in the \\u03b22 microglobulin (\\u03b22m)-KO MHC class I-deficient mice (Pascolo, S. et al.,  J Exp Med  185, 2043-2051 (1997)).  \\n      The results presented in Examples 1 and 2 show that: \\n          (1) In the HLA-A2 + HLA-DR1 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0IA\\u03b2\\u00b0 mouse, the expression of HLA-A2 molecules, the absence of expression of H2-K b  molecules, the number of CD8 +  peripheral T-lymphocytes, and the diversity of the CD8 +  T repertoire are generally comparable to the HLA-A2 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0 mouse;     (2) In the HLA-A2 + HLA-DR1 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0IA\\u03b2\\u00b0 mouse, the expression of HLA-DR1 molecules, the absence of expression of H2-IA b  molecules, the number of CD4 +  T-lymphocytes, and the diversity of the CD4 +  repertoire are generally comparable to the HLA-DR1 + IA\\u03b2\\u00b0 mouse; and     (3) The HLA-A2 + HLA-DR1 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0IA\\u03b2\\u00b0 mouse has all the characteristic advantages found in HLA-A2 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0 mice, and the HLA-DR1 + IA\\u03b2\\u00b0 mice.        \\n\\n     Example 3  \\n     TCR BV Segment Usage  \\n      As the presence of a single MHC class I and single MHC class II molecule could diminish the size and diversity of the TCR repertoire, the expression of the various BV families and the CDR3 length diversity was studied as previously described (Cochet, M. et al.,  Eur J Immunol  22, 2639-2647 (1992)) by the RT-PCR-based immunoscope technique, on purified splenic CD4 +  or CD8 +  T cells. Peaks of significant magnitude with a Gaussian-like distribution were observed for most BV families (15 out of the 20 analyzed) in both CD8 +  ( FIG. 2   b ) and CD4 +  ( FIG. 2   c ) populations of T cells. Such profiles observed on peripheral T lymphocytes are typical of functionally rearranged BV segments with a 3 nucleotide length variation of the CDR3 subregions from one peak to the next (Cochet, M. et al.,  Eur J Immunol  22, 2639-2647 (1992)).  \\n      Absence of expansion (or profoundly altered profile) as observed for BV 5.3 and 17 were expected since these two BV segments are pseudogenes in C57BL/6 mice (Wade, T., Bill, J., Marrack, P. C., Palmer, E. &amp; Kappler, J. W.,  J Immunol  141, 2165-2167 (1988)); Chou, H. S. et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  84, 1992-1996 (1987). However, the altered profiles observed for BV5.1, 5.2 and 11 segments were due to a small subpopulation of corresponding BV-expressing T cells (they represent lower than 5% in C57BL/6 mice, and around 2% in HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class II-KO mice) (data not shown). Other than these instances, both CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cells in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice display, respectively, a pattern of TCR BV chain usage and CDR3 diversity, which is similar to that of non-transgenic C57BL/6 mice.  \\n     Example 4  \\n     Functional Characterization  \\n      HLA-A2 + HLA-DR1 + \\u03b22m\\u00b0IA\\u03b2\\u00b0 mice immunized with Ag HBs (hepatitis B envelope protein) were analyzed.

This plasmid encodes two hepatitis B virus envelope proteins (preS2/S middle and S/small) that self-assemble in particles carrying hepatitis B surface antigen. The currently used vaccine against hepatitis B comprises these two proteins.  \\n      As illustrated in  FIG. 3   a  for a representative mouse, HBsAg-specific antibodies were first detected at day 12 after injection of the HBsAg-DNA-vaccine ( FIG. 3   a,  upper panel), and the titer of these antibodies increased up to day 24 (12 days after the second DNA immunization, data non shown). This early antibody response was specific for the preS2-B cell epitope (HBs 109-134 ) carried by the middle HBV envelope protein and for HBsAg particles, in agreement with a similar response reported in HBsAg-DNA-immunized mice (Michel, M. L. et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  92, 5307-5311 (1995)) and in HBsAg vaccinated humans (Moulia-Pelat, J. P. et al.,  Vaccine  12, 499-502 (1994)).  \\n      The CD8 +  CTL response to HBsAg was examined to determine whether the CD8 +  T cells in the periphery of the HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mouse were functionally restricted by the transgenic human class I molecules. In HBV-infected HLA-A2.1 +  humans, the immunodominant HLA-A2.1-restricted HBsAg-specific CTL response is directed at the HBsAg 348-357  (Maini, M. K. et al.,  Gastroenterology  117, 1386-1396 (1999)) and at the HBsAg 335-343  (Nayersina, R. et al.,  J Immunol  150, 4659-4671 (1993)) peptide (i.e., a multi-epitopic response is observed). In C57BL/6 mice, the H-2 K b -restricted HBsAg-specific CTL response is directed at the HBsAg 371-378  peptide (Schirmbeck, R., Wild, J. &amp; Reimann, J.,  Eur J Immunol  28, 4149-4161 (1998)). To evaluate whether the humanized mouse may respond as humans, splenic T cells were restimulated for 7 days, as described herein, with either relevant (HBsAg 348-357 , HLA-A2.1-restricted), or control (HBsAg 371-378 , H-2 K b -restricted; MAGE-3 271-279 , HLA-A2.1-restricted) peptide.  FIG. 3   a  (middle panel) shows that HBsAg-DNA-immunization elicited a strong HBsAg 348-357 -specific CTL response, but no response to either HBsAg 371-378  or the MAGE-3 271-279  peptide.  \\n      To determine whether the CD4 +  T cells in the periphery of this HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mouse may be functionally restricted by the transgenic human class II molecules, the CD4 +  T cell response to the HBsAg protein was examined. In HBsAg-vaccinated or HBV-infected HLA-DR1 +  humans, an immunodominant HLA-DR1-restricted HBsAg-specific CD4 +  T cell response is directed at the HBsAg 180-195  peptide (Mm, W. P. et al.,  Hum Immunol  46, 93-99 (1996)). In C57BL/6 mice, the H-2 IA b -restricted HBsAg-specific CD4 +  T cell response is directed at the HBsAg 126-138  peptide (Milich, D. R.,  Semin Liver Dis  11, 93-112(1991)). To compare the humanized mouse with humans and wild-type mice, splenic T cells were restimulated in vitro with either relevant (HBsAg 180-195 , HLA-DR1-restricted) or control (HBsAg 126-138 , H-2 IA b -restricted; HIV 1 Gag 263-278 , HLA-DR1-restricted) peptides.  FIG. 3   a  (lower panel) shows a strong proliferative response directed against the HLA-DR1-restricted HBsAg 180-195  peptide, while the H-2 IA-restricted peptide was not efficient at stimulating a response, as expected. Similarly, no response was induced by the HIV 1 Gag 263-278  peptide. Moreover, an additional in vitro recall with the HBsAg 180-195  peptide increased several-fold the specific proliferative index (data not shown).  \\n      Having documented in a first HBsAg-DNA-immunized HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mouse the development and the specificity of the HBsAg-specific antibody, proliferative and cytolytic T cell responses, 6 additional HBsAg-DNA-immunized and 6 naive control HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice were also tested individually for the same three responses. As illustrated in  FIG. 3   b,  the three reponses were simultaneously documented in the 6 immunized animals tested and not in control naive mice. Interestingly, 2 immunized mice were able to develop CTL responses against both HBsAg 348-357  and HBsAg 335-343  HLA-A2.1 restricted peptides ( FIG. 3   b,  middle panel).  \\n     Example 6  \\n     Protection Assays  \\n      The above examples document the induction of HBsAg-specific humoral, CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cell responses in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice, and show that they are directed at the same immunodominant epitopes as those of naturally-infected or HBsAg-vaccinated humans. This example tested whether these responses conferred protection to vaccinated animals. Since mice are not permissive to HBV, a HBsAg-recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV-HBsAg) was used for these experiments. Mice were immunized twice intramuscularly with 100 \\u03bcg of HBsAg-DNA. Twelve days after the last immunization, mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 10 7  PFU of rVV-HBsAg. Four days later, virus titers were determined according to published methods and recorded as rVV PFU/ovary (Buller, R. M. &amp; Wallace, G. D.,  Lab Anim Sci  35, 473-476 (1985)).  \\n      The results are illustrated in  FIG. 4 . Naive animals that had not been immunized with HBsAg-DNA showed evidence of rVV-HBsAg replication after challenge. In contrast, the virus titers in mice immunized with HBsAg-DNA were more than 4 orders of magnitude lower. These results strongly suggest that vaccination with HBsAg-DNA induced protective HBsAg-specific immune responses that controlled the infection with rVV-HBsAg.  \\n      The specificity of the protection conferred by HBsAg-DNA-vaccination was documented by challenging HBsAg-DNA-immunized mice with another HBx-recombinant VV (encoding hepatitis B x protein). No reduction of rVV-HBx replication was observed in HBsAg-DNA-immunized mice compared to unimmunized controls.  \\n     Example 7  \\n     HLA-DR1-Restricted CD4 +  T Cells Are Critical for Antibody and CTL Responses and Protection Against Viral Infection  \\n      To evaluate whether HLA-DR1-restricted T helper lymphocytes contribute to antibody and CTL responses in the humanized mice, the immune response and the efficiency of viral infection were compared in single (HLA-A2.1) and double (HLA-A2.1/HLA-DR1) transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice. As shown in Table 4, a potent HBsAg 348-357 -specific CTL response was observed in HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-double transgenic, H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice, but not in HLA-A2.1-single transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice. Furthermore, anti-HBs antibodies could not be detected in HBsAg-DNA-vaccinated HLA-A2.1- single transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice. As a consequence, HBsAg-DNA-immunized HLA-A2.1- single transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice were not protected against rVV-HBsAg infection.  \\n               TABLE 4                          Table 4 Antibody, cytolytic, and proliferative responses of HBsAg-       DNA- immunized mice, and protection against rVV-HBsAg-challenge                                     Specific Lysis   Proliferation   Anti-   rVV-HBsAg           (%)   (SI)   body   PFU/ovary                                     Mice   348-357   335-343   179-194   Titer   (log10)                                                 A   1   0   0   1   0   2.5 \\u00b7 10 8             2   0   0   1   0   2.5 \\u00b7 10 8             3   0   0   1   0   \\u200210 8             4   0   0   1   0   2.5 \\u00b7 10 8             5   0   0   1   0   \\u200210 8             6   0   0   1   0   1.5 \\u00b7 10 8         B   1   30   15   4.7   2000   \\u200210 4             2   14   0   3.9   3000   \\u2009\\u20023 \\u00b7 10 3             3   30   11   4   7500   \\u2009\\u20024 \\u00b7 10 3             4   5   0   2.5   6500   7.5 \\u00b7 10 3             5   50   30   6.3   13000   7.5 \\u00b7 10 2             6   40   18   4   16000   \\u2009\\u20025 \\u00b7 10 2             7   6   7   2.9   1500   \\u2009\\u20022 \\u00b7 10 4             8   5   5   3   2500   1.5 \\u00b7 10 4             9   24   36   4.5   3000   &lt;10 2             10   23   14   5   15000   \\u2009\\u20025 \\u00b7 10 3         C   1   0   0   1   0   \\u200210 8             2   0   0   1   0   \\u2009\\u20022 \\u00b7 10 8             3   0   0   1   0   1.5 \\u00b7 10 8             4   0   0   1   0   \\u200210 8             5   0   0   1   0   2.5 \\u00b7 10 8             6   0   0   1   0   \\u200210 8                    \\n \\n      Naive HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-double transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice (A 1-6), HBsAg-DNA-immunized HLA-A2.1-HLA-DR1-double transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice (B 1-10) and HBsAg-DNA-immunized HLA-A2.1-single transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-KO mice (C 1-6) were challenged intraperitoneally with 10 7  PFU of rVV-HBsAg.

Financial losses due to property devaluations pertaining to fungi and mycotoxins, and protein by-products of fungi is a growing concern on numerous fronts, as follow: (1) during the past ten years, pharmaceutical sales for prescriptions to treat asthma-related illness and other lung and upper respiratory diseases has increased five-fold, with annual costs for prescription drugs now exceeding 30 billion dollars; (2) medical and health insurance costs have escalated at twice the rate of inflation during the same period, seriously impacting the profit margins of both small and large business owners; (3) homeowner policies in states such as Texas have risen by forty percent, and mold coverage has been dropped by most carriers; (4) average remediation costs in 2002 for a home in Dallas, Tex., was $45,000; (5) the average time to complete a remediation job is 120 days; (6) insurance companies offering homeowners insurance in the state of Florida are seriously considering dropping mold coverage altogether; (7) in New Jersey, if a homeowner reports an infestation of mold in their property, that damage may be repaired through the insurer, however, the homeowner and the property remediated become black-listed as to future coverage; (8) the clear trend is for insurance companies to drop mold coverage entirely, as has been the experience in Texas; this trend is spreading to other states, compelling homeowners and commercial property owners to self-insure against this costly problem, in which case, many people find themselves without the financial means to deal with the consequences of devaluation and human health risks associated with the contamination.  \\n      In a tight commercial real estate market, this translates into a public health concern as remediations are considered quite costly and, as the direct result, many remediation or restoration jobs are delayed, or not scheduled at all, thereby enabling the human health risk to remain in place beyond a reasonable time and perhaps indefinitely, expanding exposure risks for no other reason than lack of immediate financial means at the critical moment. Mold spores continue to germinate and spread via the air handling system(s) and exposure levels to humans increases even more. The ultimate consequence is known as chronic exposure.  \\n      The invention has special importance in the remediation and restoration industry. It may be incorporated into a cleaning and remediation program offered by service contractors, building contractors, and remediation/cleaning companies. Without this unique and effective technology, the exposure cycle to fungi will continue.  \\n      Property devaluation, financial loss, and potential illness to risk groups, especially including children and the elderly, are an absolute certainty without effective fungi and related protein treatment to clean and remove the harmful substances.  \\n      It would be a considerable advantage on all fronts, including occupants, residents, insurers, mortgage lenders, property management firms, realtors, and the like, if these fungi and fungi-derived damaging influences could be eliminated or at least substantially curtailed. Current remediation and restoration technologies, which rely heavily upon older, toxic chemical products, have and continue to deliver less than entirely satisfactory results while introducing additional human health risks of their own. Therefore there is an immediate need for the technology of this invention, which has been developed specifically to address the fungi and allergenic protein concerns noted above.  \\n      Numerous laboratories throughout the country, including the University of Florida, INX Laboratories, Inc., of Claremont, Fla., and medical researchers including the Mayo Clinic, have identified several of the offending fungi species of the above noted health concerns. Documentation on known human health risks to extended exposure of certain fungi species is becoming more available to the public. The State of Florida and the University of Florida are both especially interested in this endeavor because the State has one of the largest known mold problems in the country, seriously impacting the health of children, workers, homeowners, the elderly, individuals with compromised immune systems, and such; the mold problem thus has a significant financial impact on insurance companies and their policy decisions relative to whether or not mold coverage is to be included or excluded on future coverage plans.  \\n      An additional concern held by many is the looming prospect of mandatory mold inspections, requiring documentation and disclosure prior to transfer of residential real estate, which practice is becoming law in many states, including Florida and California presently, with others presumably to follow shortly thereafter. As a consequence, property values could be lowered and insurability of identified properties could become a concern for both buyer and seller. Lowering property values has a tremendous financial impact on the tax revenues generated for state governments. The State of Florida is deeply concerned. This situation has already been experienced in Texas, where there currently exists 4 billion dollars in losses to the State and individual homeowners. Failures by various building contractors, general contractors, and remediation companies, to successfully remediate many of these properties, has resulted in additional losses through one half billion dollars in lawsuits filed by insurance companies against such contractors and remediators, who had been paid essentially for ineffective work because the products and methodologies they relied upon simply could not produce the desired results on a consistent and reliable basis.  \\n      As stated above, any losses related to fungi contamination in living spaces significantly impact the profits anticipated by insurance companies, as well as the tax revenues anticipated by the state governments, which needs those dollars to finance public school operation and state administration.  \\n      Awareness of fungal problems is well established in the scientific, medical, real estate, banking and insurance communities, as well as at the homeowner level. Public awareness of such things as a significant increase in childhood asthma and the increased incidence of lower respiratory infections, including bronchial pneumonias, has caused alarm and concern over the condition and safety of buildings and homes relative to possible mold infestation. There is additional public and medical community concern relative to the acknowledged over-prescription of certain antibiotics, steroids, and other drugs used to treat such illnesses.  \\n      Traditional mold treatment remedies that have been and continue to be used primarily include: (1) chemical bleach washes and alkaline-based washes; and (2) demolition and reconstruction. Both alternatives are expensive and inconvenient; neither have demonstrated a consistent or reliable capacity to deliver completely satisfactory results, which explains, for example, the Texas lawsuits mentioned earlier. Neither surface wash methodologies nor demolition/reconstruction alternatives are truly capable of rendering a property completely safe and free of fungi. For instance, common problems among remediation contractors resulting in recurrence include failure to remediate the air handling system or the hvac coil, where mold germination occurs. Typically, within weeks or months, the fungi return and once again cause discomfort and illness among those predisposed by age or genetics to be most sensitive.  \\n      These ineffective remedies must be replaced by a more effective and safer technology. That is precisely why this invention was formulated. If not completely replacing one of the current technologies, the formulation should at least be used in conjunction with one of the traditional methodologies. In the State of Florida, an estimated two billion dollars will be spent on mold remediation over the next year, and up to five billion will be spent over the next four years in attempts to control this problem. Without the use of this invention, remediation efforts will be less successful and, as Texas experience has demonstrated, much of the work will have to be repeated at additional, and unnecessary expense to the homeowner, insurer, and state government. In the State of Florida, by financial impact, the biggest losers will be the mortgage lenders, the insurers, and the State itself, which loses important tax revenues each time a devalued property is transferred. Additional victims include the half million children in the state suffering from asthma, as well as new homeowners who purchase properties under inadequate inspection conditions.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The offending fungi have been identified and include various spores, mycelium and related proteins. Some of these species include, but are not limited to,  Aspergillus fumagatis, Aspergillus visicolor  and  Cladosporium    and    Penicillium spp . The enzyme-based invention was formulated specifically and exclusively to combat fungi, spores, mycelium and proteins. Product safety and efficacy have been documented by university and laboratory studies, commercial laboratory studies, and by field applications and case studies across the country. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The unique, proprietary formula of the invention is comprised of a combination of safe, non-toxic organic enzymes and catalysts using natural, plant-derived enzymes, and enzymes derived from fungi. This proprietary formulation breaks down polysaccharide cell walls, after which the enzymes destroy and neutralize the protein content of the offending fungi spores, and mycelium as well as any extracellular surface proteins, on contact. This unique technology penetrates porous surfaces through a capillary mode of action and leaves behind an inhibitory surface residue, which protects the building materials from fungal re-growth. This technology provides resistance management against such fingi and their spore germination. The residual inhibition contained in this technology lasts up to one year on treated common building materials.  \\n      Prediction modeling, a method to forecast the extended efficacy of the discussed technology on common building materials, has been tested by using the product on known fungi under above average temperature conditions to accelerate growth rates for such fungi. Treatment controls and positive controls using other alternative technologies have been evaluated as well. The formulation continues to work until contiguous substrate sources have been eliminated. The invention used and applied, as described in the following methods and applications steps, is a non-toxic, enzyme-based formulation that neutralizes fungi mycelium, spores and proteins on contact. The technology provides resistance management, a barrier technology on surface areas of common building materials to include numerous types such as wall board, ventilation and air handling surface areas, AC coils, sub flooring, wood, carpeting, sheetrock, and the like.  \\n      The method of extending the resistance to fungi growth in places of work and habitation to include residential dwellings, apartments, condominiums, commercial properties, offices, modular buildings, maritime and aviation vessels, and industrial workplaces, is to spray or atomize or surface coat the building materials and related surface areas with the formula explained as follows:  \\n      The treatment steps may involve two (2) or more methods.  \\n      1. Standard Spray Applications:  \\n      An application using a liquid spray, which involves coating surface areas with the liquid enzyme formulation with particles greater than fifteen (15) microns in size to treat infected surface areas and to prevent the occurrence of fungi growth and spore germination.  \\n      2. Atomization Fumigation:  \\n      The atomization fumigation application of the product involves misting the enzyme formulation with particles of less than fifteen (15) microns in size to treat infected surface areas and to prevent the occurrence of fungi growth and spore germination.  \\n      In the above two (2) mentioned and discussed methods of application, it has been found that the condition of building materials, exposed surface areas, and indoor air quality, have been substantially improved as the direct result of the introduction of the invention. It is most likely that the significant improvements attributable to this technology will be measured in consistent and reliable positive changes in indoor air quality, and a corresponding reduction in human health risks and experiences that would otherwise have been recorded through harmful fungi exposure. Numerous indicators will abound, but the simplest and most obvious measure will be the reduction noted in annual pharmaceutical sales data for specific prescriptions such as bronchial dilators, and steroids to treat asthma in children and the elderly.  \\n      The above mentioned processes allow for the enzyme-based formula to be applied to areas affected with known fungi, and works to inhibit fungal spore germination and mycelium growth. This technology is to be used to treat multiple types of materials and their surface areas, primarily to manage fungi growth, and limit and inhibit fungi growth on related surface areas.  \\n      The unique, proprietary, non-toxic organic enzyme-based formula of this invention may help to protect humans against excessive exposure to potential health risks, which risks they have been and continue to be exposed to on a daily basis in such places as public schools, government offices, places of work, homes and the like, essentially because the facilities have either not been treated with the invention, or have been treated with some inferior alternative remedy.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005150243-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The present invention provides a heat source unit capable of being used in either an air conditioner for switchable cooling and heating operation or an air conditioner for simultaneous cooling and heating operation.

Each utilization unit includes a utilization side refrigerant circuit that includes a utilization side heat exchanger and a utilization side expanding means. The heat source unit includes a heat source side refrigerant circuit that includes a compressing means that compresses a refrigerant, a main heat exchanger, a first switching means for making the main heat exchanger to function as an evaporator and a condenser, and a main refrigerant switching means that includes a motor operated expansion valve capable of regulating the refrigerant flow of the main heat exchanger. The utilization side refrigerant circuit and the heat source side refrigerant circuit are connected via a connecting refrigerant circuit. In such an air conditioner, the load of the heat source unit is regulated according to the load of the plurality of utilization units, and operation is performed so that the thermal balance of the entire refrigeration cycle is satisfied. For example, the air conditioner is constituted so that the main heat exchanger is actuated as the evaporator during heating operation or during simultaneous cooling and heating operation; therefore, the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant is varied in the main heat exchanger by regulating the opening of the main refrigerant switching means, thus balancing the load of the utilization units and the load of the heat source unit. At this time, the variation in the amount of evaporation of the main heat exchanger is achieved by regulating the opening of the main refrigerant switching means while fixedly maintaining the high pressure refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means of the heat source unit. In other words, if the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger is greater than the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant corresponding to the load of the utilization units, then the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant is reduced by restricting the opening of the main refrigerant switching means because there is a tendency for the high pressure refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means of the heat source unit to increase. Conversely, if the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger is less than the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant corresponding to the load of the utilization units, then the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant is increased by enlarging the opening of the main refrigerant switching means because there is a tendency for the high pressure refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means of the heat source unit to decrease.  \\n      As an example of another conventional air conditioner, one is known that provides, inside the heat source unit, an auxiliary heat exchanger provided in parallel with the main heat exchanger and that functions as the condenser. This air conditioner is constituted so that the load of the utilization units and the load of the heat source unit are balanced by regulating the thermal balance of the entire heat source unit by actuating and stopping the auxiliary heat exchanger. In other words, if the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger is greater than the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant corresponding to the load of the utilization units, then there is a tendency for the high pressure refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means of the heat source unit to increase; consequently, the thermal balance of the entire heat source unit is regulated by actuating the auxiliary heat exchanger to increase the amount of condensation and to offset the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant of the main heat exchanger. Conversely, if the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger is less than the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant corresponding to the load of the utilization units, then there is a tendency for the high pressure refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means of the heat source unit to decrease; consequently, the thermal balance of the entire heat source unit is regulated by stopping the auxiliary heat exchanger to decrease the amount of condensation.  \\n      An air conditioner is also known that includes both the above mentioned main refrigerant switching means and the auxiliary heat exchanger. Such an air conditioner is basically constituted so that the loads of the utilization units are balanced by actuating and stopping the auxiliary heat exchanger to regulate the thermal balance of the entire heat source unit, and so that fine adjustment is performed by regulating the opening of the main refrigerant switching means.  \\n      In an air conditioner that balances the load of the utilization units and the load of the heat source unit by regulating the thermal balance via the main refrigerant switching means and the auxiliary heat exchanger of the heat source unit, the greater the condensing capacity of the auxiliary heat exchanger is with respect to the evaporative capacity of the main heat exchanger, the more the range of regulation of the heat source unit with respect to the fluctuation in the load of the utilization units is unfortunately limited. For example, if the capacity of the auxiliary heat exchanger is increased, then the fluctuations in the refrigerant pressure on the high pressure side may unfortunately increase due to actuating and stopping of the auxiliary heat exchanger. Conversely, if the capacity of the auxiliary heat exchanger is decreased, then the range over which regulation must be performed by the main refrigerant switching means unfortunately increases; consequently, it may no longer be possible to restrict the amount of evaporation of the main heat exchanger particularly if the heating load of the utilization units is small.  \\n      Thus, in a conventional air conditioner capable of switchable operation or simultaneous cooling and heating operation, it is problematic to optimize the thermal balance of the heating load of the utilization units and the evaporative performance of the heat source unit while maintaining controllability.  \\n      In addition, in the above mentioned conventional air conditioner for switchable cooling and heating operation and the air conditioner for simultaneous cooling and heating operation, the model of the utilization units is shared, but the model of the heat source unit varies, which leads to an increase in manufacturing costs.  \\n     DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION  \\n      It is an object of the present invention to provide a heat source unit capable of being used in either an air conditioner for switchable heating and cooling operation or an air conditioner for simultaneous cooling and heating operation.  \\n      The heat source unit of an air conditioner as recited in Claim  1  is a heat source unit of an air conditioner including a heat source side refrigerant circuit connected to a plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits via a connecting refrigerant circuit, including a compressing means, a main heat exchanger, an auxiliary heat exchanger, a refrigerant liquid piping, a first refrigerant gas piping, a second refrigerant gas piping, a main refrigerant switching means, an auxiliary refrigerant switching means, a first switching means, and a second switching means. The compressing means compresses the refrigerant gas. The main heat exchanger functions as an evaporator and a condenser of the refrigerant. The auxiliary heat exchanger is connected in parallel with the main heat exchanger and functions as an evaporator and a condenser of the refrigerant. The refrigerant liquid piping is connected to the connecting refrigerant circuit. The first refrigerant gas piping is connected to the connecting refrigerant circuit. The second refrigerant gas piping delivers the refrigerant gas from the connecting refrigerant circuit to the intake side of the compressing means. The main refrigerant switching means is connected between the refrigerant liquid piping and the main heat exchanger. The auxiliary refrigerant switching means is connected between the refrigerant liquid piping and the auxiliary heat exchanger. The first switching means is capable of switching between the state wherein the refrigerant gas side of the main heat exchanger is connected to the discharge side of the compressing means, the intake side of the compressing means is connected to the first refrigerant gas piping, and the low pressure refrigerant gas is made to be taken into the compressing means; and the state wherein the refrigerant gas side of the main heat exchanger is connected to the intake side of the compressing means, the discharge side of the compressing means is connected to the first refrigerant gas piping, and the high pressure refrigerant gas is made to be discharged from the compressing means. The second switching means is capable of switching between the state wherein the refrigerant gas side of the auxiliary heat exchanger is connected to the discharge side of the compressing means, and the state wherein the refrigerant gas side of the auxiliary heat exchanger is connected to the intake side of the compressing means. Further, the first refrigerant gas piping is capable of flowing the refrigerant gas from the connecting refrigerant circuit to the first switching means, and of flowing the refrigerant gas from the first switching means to the connecting refrigerant circuit.  \\n      The conventional heat source unit for a simultaneous cooling and heating device is connected in parallel with the main heat exchanger, and includes an auxiliary heat exchanger that functions only as the condenser. In this heat source unit, when the plurality of utilization units principally performs cooling operation and only some of the utilization units perform low-load heating operation, operation is sometimes performed to regulate the load of the heat source unit by actuating the main heat exchanger as the condenser, and supplying the discharge refrigerant gas of the compressing means to the first refrigerant gas piping while supplying the refrigerant liquid from the refrigerant liquid piping. To enable such operation, the conventional heat source unit is provided with a delivery piping switchable by a solenoid valve for delivering a portion of the discharge refrigerant gas of the compressing means to the first refrigerant gas piping. The first refrigerant gas piping is provided with a check valve capable of only flowing the refrigerant gas from the first switching means side to the connecting refrigerant circuit side; when this delivery piping is used, the refrigerant gas on the discharge side of the compressing means does not flow from the first refrigerant gas piping to the intake side of the compressing means via the first switching means. Consequently, because the first refrigerant gas piping cannot be used as the refrigerant gas piping for the switchable cooling and heating device, the heat source unit for a conventional simultaneous cooling and heating device cannot be used as the heat source unit for the switchable cooling and heating device.  \\n      However, in the heat source unit of the air conditioner of the present invention, the auxiliary heat exchanger conventionally used only as the condenser is used as the evaporator. Specifically, it is constituted so that a second switching means is provided, which can switch so that the auxiliary heat exchanger functions as an evaporator or a condenser. Consequently, in this heat source unit, there is no need to perform the operation of supplying the discharged refrigerant gas of the compressing means to the first refrigerant gas piping while actuating the main heat exchanger as the condenser, as in the conventional heat source unit for a simultaneous cooling and heating device, and the load of the heat source unit can be regulated by actuating the main heat exchanger as the condenser and actuating the auxiliary heat exchanger as the evaporator. Consequently, there is no need in this heat source unit for the check valve of the first refrigerant gas piping and the delivery piping provided in a conventional heat source unit.  \\n      Thereby, this heat source unit of an air conditioner can be used in either the air conditioner for switchable cooling and heating operation or the air conditioner for simultaneous cooling and heating operation because, in the first refrigerant gas piping, the refrigerant gas can flow from the connecting refrigerant circuit to the first switching means, the refrigerant gas can flow from the first switching means to the connecting refrigerant circuit, and the first refrigerant gas piping can be used as the refrigerant gas piping for the switchable cooling and heating device.  \\n      An air conditioner as recited in Claim  2  includes: a heat source side refrigerant circuit of the heat source unit as recited in Claim  1 ; a plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits that each include a utilization side heat exchanger and a utilization side expanding means; and a connecting refrigerant circuit for connecting the heat source side refrigerant circuit and the utilization side refrigerant circuits; wherein, the refrigerant liquid piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected to the refrigerant liquid side of the utilization side expanding means via the connecting refrigerant circuit; the first refrigerant gas piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected so that the high pressure refrigerant gas can be delivered to the refrigerant gas side of the utilization side heat exchangers via the connecting refrigerant circuit; and the second refrigerant gas piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected so that the low pressure refrigerant gas can return from the utilization side refrigerant circuits to the heat source side refrigerant circuit via the connecting refrigerant circuit.  \\n      In this air conditioner, the refrigerant liquid piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit, the first refrigerant gas piping, and the second refrigerant gas piping are connected to a plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits via the connecting refrigerant circuit, and an air conditioner capable of simultaneous cooling and heating operation can consequently be constituted.  \\n      An air conditioner as recited in Claim  3  includes: the heat source side refrigerant circuit of the heat source unit as recited in Claim  1 ; a plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits that each include a utilization side heat exchanger and a utilization side expanding means; and a connecting refrigerant circuit for connecting the heat source side refrigerant circuit and the utilization side refrigerant circuits; wherein, the refrigerant liquid piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected to the refrigerant liquid side of the utilization side expanding means of the utilization side refrigerant circuits via the connecting refrigerant circuit; the first refrigerant gas piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected to the utilization side heat exchangers of the utilization side refrigerant circuits via the connecting refrigerant circuit; and the second refrigerant gas piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is constituted so that it is not connected to the connecting refrigerant circuit and refrigerant gas does not flow therein.  \\n      The circuit of this air conditioner is constituted so that the refrigerant liquid piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit and the first refrigerant gas piping are connected to a plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits via the connecting refrigerant circuit, and the second refrigerant gas piping is not connected to any circuit. Further, the refrigerant gas can flow between the heat source side refrigerant circuit and the utilization side refrigerant circuits via the first refrigerant gas piping. Thereby, an air conditioner capable of switchable cooling and heating operation can be constituted.  \\n      An air conditioner as recited in Claim  4  includes: the heat source side refrigerant circuit of the heat source unit as recited in Claim  1 ; a plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits that each include a utilization side heat exchanger and a utilization side expanding means; and a connecting refrigerant circuit for connecting the heat source side refrigerant circuit and the utilization side refrigerant circuits. The refrigerant liquid piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected to the refrigerant liquid side of the utilization side expanding means of each utilization side refrigerant circuit via the connecting refrigerant circuit; the second refrigerant gas piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected to the utilization side heat exchanger of some of the plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits via the connecting refrigerant circuit. The first refrigerant gas piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit is connected to the utilization side heat exchangers of the other utilization side refrigerant circuits via the connecting refrigerant circuit.  \\n      The circuit in this air conditioner is constituted so that a plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits, excepting some, are connected to the refrigerant liquid piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit and the first refrigerant gas piping via the connecting refrigerant circuit, and some of the plurality of utilization side refrigerant circuits are connected to the refrigerant liquid piping of the heat source side refrigerant circuit and the second refrigerant gas piping via the connecting refrigerant circuit. Further, some of the utilization side refrigerant circuits operate so that, regardless of the operation state of the heat source side refrigerant circuit, the refrigerant liquid from the refrigerant liquid piping or the connecting refrigerant circuit is supplied, and is made to pass through the utilization side expanding means and the utilization side heat exchangers, whereupon the low pressure refrigerant gas returns to the second refrigerant gas piping. However, the other utilization side refrigerant circuits operate so that, when the refrigerant liquid is supplied from the refrigerant liquid piping, it is made to pass through the utilization side expanding means and the utilization side heat exchangers, and then the low pressure refrigerant gas returns to the first refrigerant gas piping; and when the high pressure refrigerant gas is supplied from the first refrigerant gas piping, it is made to pass through the utilization side heat exchangers and the utilization side expanding means, and the refrigerant liquid then returns to the refrigerant liquid piping.

The above mentioned first connecting piping bank  5 , the refrigerant circuit of connecting units  4 , and the second connecting piping bank  6  constitute a connecting refrigerant circuit  7 .  \\n      As described above, the heat source side refrigerant circuit  2   a  and the utilization side refrigerant circuits  3   a  are connected via a connecting refrigerant circuit  7 , thus constituting the refrigerant circuit of the air conditioner  1  capable of simultaneous cooling and heating operation.  \\n      (2) Operation of the Air Conditioner  \\n      The following explains the operation of the air conditioner  1  of the present embodiment.  \\n      Depending on the cooling and heating load of the utilization units  3 , the air conditioner  1  of the present embodiment can switch among the heating operation mode that performs heating operation of all utilization units  3 , the low load heating operation mode for the case wherein the heating operation load is small, a simultaneous heating and cooling operation mode for the case of combining a utilization unit  3  that performs heating operation with a utilization unit  3  that performs cooling operation, and a cooling operation mode that performs cooling operation of all utilization units  3 .  \\n      {circle over (1)} Heating operation mode  \\n      When all utilization units  3  perform heating operation, the refrigerant circuit of the air conditioner  1  is constituted as shown in  FIG. 2  (the refrigerant flow is shown in the figure by the arrow).  \\n      Specifically, in the heat source side refrigerant circuit  2   a  of the heat source unit  2 , the first switching means VI and the second switching means V 3  switch as shown in  FIG. 2 , and the main heat exchanger  22  and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  are actuated as evaporators by the main refrigerant switching means V 2  and the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4  transitioning to the open state. In the utilization side refrigerant circuit  3   a  of each of the utilization units  3 , the utilization side heat exchanger  32  for heating the indoors is actuated as the condenser of the refrigerant by the utilization side expanding means V 7  transitioning to the open state. In each connecting unit  4 , the solenoid valves V 8 , V 10  transition to the closed state, and the solenoid valve V 9  transitions to the open state.  \\n      In the constitution of such a refrigerant circuit, the refrigerant gas compressed by the compressing means  21  is delivered to the connecting unit  4  via the first switching means V 1 , the first refrigerant gas piping  26 , and the first connecting piping bank  5 . Further, this refrigerant gas is delivered to the utilization side heat exchanger  32  via the solenoid valve V 9 , and becomes refrigerant liquid by heat exchanging with the indoor air. This refrigerant liquid is delivered to the subcooling heat exchanger  41  via the utilization side expanding means V 7 . Further, this subcooled refrigerant liquid is delivered to the main heat exchanger  22  and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  via the refrigerant liquid piping  25 , the main refrigerant switching means V 2 , and the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4 . The refrigerant liquid delivered to the main heat exchanger  22  and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  is evaporated, and then delivered to the intake side of the compressing means  21  via the first switching means V 1  and the second switching means V 3 .  \\n      {circle over (2)} Low Load Heating Operation Mode  \\n      Next, if the heating operation load of the utilization units  3  decreases, then the evaporative load on the heat source unit  2  side becomes excessive, and the high pressure side refrigerant pressure (pressure sensor P 2 ) on the discharge side of the compressing means  21  rises. In contrast, in the state of the refrigerant circuit shown in  FIG. 2 , the main refrigerant switching means V 2  is gradually closed, the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger  22  decreases to prevent an increase in the refrigerant pressure (pressure sensor P 2 ) on the high pressure side.  \\n      Furthermore, at the point in time when the heating operation load of the utilization units  3  decreases and the main refrigerant switching means V 2  is restricted to a prescribed opening, the refrigerant circuit of the air conditioner  1  switches as shown in  FIG. 3  (the refrigerant flow is shown in the figure by the arrow).  \\n      Specifically, in the heat source side refrigerant circuit  2   a  of the heat source unit  2 , the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4  is shut off, the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  is stopped, whereupon the second switching means V 3  then switches as shown in  FIG. 3 , and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  can be reactivated as the condenser when the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4  transitions to the open state.  \\n      In the constitution of such a refrigerant circuit, the refrigerant pressure of the discharge side of the compressing means  21  tends to decline because the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant decreases stepwise attendant with the stopping of the auxiliary heat exchanger  23 . In contrast, an attempt is made to increase the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger  22  by opening the main refrigerant switching means V 2 . Thereby, the evaporative load of the heat source unit  2  and the heating load of the utilization units  3  balance, and the refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means  21  stabilizes.  \\n      Furthermore, if the heating operation load of the utilization units  3  decreases (e.g., if one among three utilization units  3  stops), then the evaporative load on the heat source unit  2  side becomes excessive, leading to a tendency for the refrigerant pressure on the high pressure side to increase. In contrast, the opening of the main refrigerant switching means V 2  is once again restricted, and the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger  22  is decreased, thereby preventing an increase in the refrigerant pressure on the high pressure side. Furthermore, at the point in time when the main refrigerant switching means V 2  is once again restricted to a predetermined opening, the refrigerant circuit of the air conditioner  1  switches as shown in  FIG. 4  (the refrigerant flow is shown in the figure by the arrow).  \\n      Specifically, in the heat source side refrigerant circuit  2   a  of the heat source unit  2 , the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4  transitions to the open state, a portion of the refrigerant gas discharged from the compressing means  21  is delivered via the second switching means V 3  to the auxiliary heat exchanger  23 , which is actuated as the condenser. Only one unit of the utilization units  3  performs heating operation, and the other two units are stopped by shutting off the utilization side expanding means V 7  and the solenoid valves V 9 .  \\n      In the constitution of such a refrigerant circuit, actuating the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  as the condenser causes the amount of condensation of the refrigerant to increase stepwise, and the amount of evaporation to decrease relatively; consequently, the refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means  21  tends to decrease. In contrast, an attempt is made to increase the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger  22  by opening the main refrigerant switching means V 2 . Thereby, the evaporative load of the heat source unit  2  and the heating load of the utilization unit  3  can be balanced, and the refrigerant pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means  21  can be stabilized. Subsequently, if the heating operation load of the utilization units  3  further decreases (e.g., if two units among the three units of utilization units  3  stop), then the opening of the main refrigerant switching means V 2  once again is restricted and the amount of evaporation of the refrigerant in the main heat exchanger  22  is reduced, thereby balancing the heating load of the utilization units  3  and the evaporative load of the heat source unit  2 .  \\n      {circle over (3)} Simultaneous Heating and Cooling Operation Mode  \\n      Herein, the case will now be explained wherein one unit among the three units of utilization units  3  performs cooling operation, and the other two units perform heating operation. In this operation mode, the refrigerant circuit of the air conditioner  1  is constituted as shown in  FIG. 5  (the refrigerant flow is shown in the figure by the arrow).  \\n      Specifically, in the heat source side refrigerant circuit  2   a  of the heat source unit  2 , the main heat exchanger  22  is actuated as the evaporator, and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  is actuated as the condenser, the same as the constitution of the refrigerant circuit of the low load heating operation mode in  FIG. 4 . The utilization units  3  are constituted so that, in the utilization side refrigerant circuit  3   a  of the utilization unit  3  that performs cooling operation, the utilization side expanding means V 7  can be actuated as a pressure reducing valve, and the utilization side heat exchangers  32  for cooling the indoors can be actuated as the evaporator of the refrigerant. In the refrigerant circuit of the connecting unit  4 , the solenoid valve V 8  transitions to the open state, and the solenoid valves V 9 , V 10  transition to the closed state.  \\n      In the constitution of such a refrigerant circuit, the refrigerant gas compressed by the compressing means  21  is bifurcated into a portion delivered to the connecting units  4  via the first switching means VI, the first refrigerant gas piping  26 , and the first connecting piping bank  5 , and a portion delivered to the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  via the second switching means V 3 . Furthermore, the refrigerant gas delivered to the connecting units  4  is delivered via the solenoid valves V 9  to the utilization side heat exchanger  32  of the utilization side refrigerant circuit  3   a  of each of the two units of utilization units  3  that perform heating operation, and heat exchanged with the indoor air, thereby condensing and forming the refrigerant liquid. This refrigerant liquid is delivered to the subcooling heat exchangers  41  via the utilization side expanding means V 7 , and subcooled by the subcooling heat exchangers  41 . Furthermore, this subcooled refrigerant liquid is delivered to the main heat exchanger  22  via the refrigerant liquid piping  25  and the main refrigerant switching means V 2 . Furthermore, the pressure of a portion of the refrigerant liquid subcooled by the subcooling heat exchangers  41  is reduced by the pressure reducing piping  42 , then delivered to the subcooling heat exchangers  41  where it is heat exchanged and evaporated, and delivered to the intake side of the compressing means  21  via the first connecting piping bank  5  and the second refrigerant gas piping  28 . The refrigerant gas delivered to the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  is condensed by the auxiliary heat exchanger  23 , and then merged on the liquid side of the main heat exchanger  22  via the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4 . Furthermore, the merged refrigerant liquid is evaporated by the main heat exchanger  22 , and then delivered to the intake side of the compressing means  21  via the first switching means V 1 . However, in the utilization side refrigerant circuit  3   a  of the utilization unit  3  that performs cooling operation, a portion of the refrigerant liquid condensed in the other two units of utilization side refrigerant circuits  3   a  performing heating operation and that returns to the heat source side refrigerant circuit  2   a  through the refrigerant liquid piping  25  is delivered to the utilization side heat exchanger  32  via the utilization side expanding means V 7  of the utilization side refrigerant circuit  3   a  of the utilization unit  3 , and heat exchanges with the indoor air, thereby evaporating and forming refrigerant gas. This refrigerant gas returns to the second refrigerant gas piping  28  via the solenoid valve V 8 .  \\n      {circle over (4)} Cooling Operation Mode  \\n      When all utilization units  3  perform cooling operation, the refrigerant circuit of the air conditioner  1  is constituted as shown in  FIG. 6  (the refrigerant flow is shown in the figure by the arrow).  \\n      Specifically, in the heat source side refrigerant circuit  2   a  of the heat source unit  2 , the first switching means V 1  and the second switching means V 3  switch as shown in  FIG. 6 , and the main refrigerant switching means V 2  and the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4  transition to the open state, thereby making the main heat exchanger  22  and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  function as condensers. In the utilization side refrigerant circuits  3   a  of the utilization units  3 , the utilization side expanding means V 7  transitions to the open state, thereby making each of the utilization side heat exchangers  32  to function as evaporators of the refrigerant in order to cool the indoors. In the refrigerant circuits of the connecting units  4 , the solenoid valves V 8  transition to the open state, and the solenoid valves V 9 , V 10  transition to the closed state.  \\n      In the constitution of such a refrigerant circuit, the refrigerant gas compressed by the compressing means  21  is delivered to the main heat exchanger  22  and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  via the first switching means V 1  and the second switching means V 3 , and condensed. Furthermore, this refrigerant liquid is delivered to the connecting unit  4  via the refrigerant liquid piping  25  and the first connecting piping bank  5 . Furthermore, the pressure of this refrigerant liquid is reduced by the utilization side expanding means V 7 , and then delivered to the utilization side heat exchangers  32 , where it is evaporated by heat exchanging with the indoor air to form a refrigerant gas. This refrigerant gas is delivered to the intake side of the compressing means  21  via the solenoid valves V 8  and the second refrigerant gas piping  28 .  \\n      (3) Features of the Air Conditioner  \\n      The air conditioner  1  of the present embodiment has the following features.  \\n      {circle over (1)} Constitution of the Refrigerant Circuit Capable of Making the Auxiliary Heat Exchanger Function as the Evaporator  \\n      In the air conditioner  1  of the present embodiment, the auxiliary heat exchanger conventionally used only as the condenser is used as the evaporator (refer to  FIG. 2 ). Specifically, the second switching means V 3  is provided, which is constituted so that the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  can be switched between functioning as the evaporator and the condenser. Thereby, if the main heat exchanger  22  is actuated as the evaporator, as during heating operation or during simultaneous cooling and heating operation, then it becomes possible to make the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  function as the evaporator, and a design can be effected so that the maximum evaporative load needed when all utilization units  3  perform heating operation can be made to correspond to the total evaporative capacity of the evaporative capacity of the main heat exchanger  22  and the evaporative capacity of the auxiliary heat exchanger  23 . Namely, because it is no longer necessary for just the evaporative capacity of the main heat exchanger  22  to correspond to the evaporative load when all utilization units  3  are performing heating operation, as in the conventional case, the evaporative capacity of the main heat exchanger  22  can be reduced, thus enabling a reduction in the lower limit of the evaporative load that can be regulated by the main refrigerant switching means V 2 . Thereby, the range of regulation of the evaporative load of the heat source unit  2  widens, making it possible to optimize the thermal balance between the heating load of the utilization units  3  and the evaporative load of the heat source unit  2  during heating operation or during simultaneous cooling and heating operation.  \\n      In addition, by reducing the evaporative capacity of the main heat exchanger  22 , the total heat exchange capacity of the main heat exchanger  22  and the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  decreases more than the total heat exchange capacity of a conventional heat source unit. Thereby, a reduction in the cost and the space requirement of the apparatus is achieved.  \\n      {circle over (2)} Constitution Wherein the Water Side of the Main Heat Exchanger and the Water Side of the Auxiliary Heat Exchanger are Connected in Series  \\n      In the air conditioner  1  of the present embodiment, the refrigerant side of the main heat exchanger  22  and the refrigerant side of the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  are connected in parallel, but the water side is connected in series. Thereby, a sufficient amount of water can be ensured even if only the main heat exchanger  22  is operating.  \\n      {circle over (3)} Structure Provided on the Upper Side of the Water Inlets of the Main Heat Exchanger and the Auxiliary Heat Exchanger  \\n      Because the air conditioner  1  of the present embodiment has a structure wherein a water inlet is provided on the upper side of, and a water outlet is provided on the lower side of each of the heat exchangers  22 ,  23 , water can flow inside each of the heat exchangers  22 ,  23  from above to below. Thereby, it becomes difficult for corrosive components and the like contained in the water to stagnate inside the heat exchangers  22 ,  23 , and scaling can be suppressed.  \\n      {circle over (2)} Constitution Wherein the Wain Heat Exchanger and the Auxiliary Heat Exchanger are made Plate Heat Exchangers  \\n      Because the air conditioner  1  of the present embodiment employs plate heat exchangers for the heat exchangers  22 ,  23 , the heat source unit  2  can be made more compact compared with the case of using a double pipe type heat exchanger and the like.  \\n     Second Embodiment  \\n       FIG. 7  is a view that depicts the main components of the refrigerant circuit of an air conditioner  101  according to the second embodiment of the present invention.  \\n      The basic constitution of the air conditioner  101  is the same as the air conditioner  1  of the first embodiment, with a difference only in that the solenoid valve employed as the auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 4  in the first embodiment is changed to the motor operated expansion valve capable of controlling the refrigerant flow. Thereby, the air conditioner  101  of the present embodiment has features the same as those of the air conditioner  1  of the first embodiment, and also has the following features.  \\n      Because the air conditioner  101  of the present embodiment employs a motor operated expansion valve capable of controlling the refrigerant flow in an auxiliary refrigerant switching means V 104  of a heat source side refrigerant circuit  102   a,  the amount of evaporation and amount of condensation of the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  can be continuously regulated. Thereby, the stepwise changes in the amount of evaporation and amount of condensation of the refrigerant due to the activation and stopping of the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  can be reduced, and the fluctuations in the pressure on the discharge side of the compressing means  21  can be suppressed.  \\n     Third Embodiment  \\n       FIG. 8  is a view that depicts the main components of the refrigerant circuit of an air conditioner  201  according to the third embodiment of the present invention.  \\n      The air conditioner  201  uses the heat source unit  2  for the simultaneous cooling and heating device of the first embodiment as the heat source unit for the switchable cooling and heating device. Herein, the constitution of the heat source unit  2  and the utilization units  3  is the same as that of the first embodiment. In addition, the connecting units  4  for the simultaneous cooling and heating device are eliminated. Further, the first refrigerant gas piping  26  of the heat source unit  2  and the utilization side heat exchangers  32  of the utilization units  3  are connected via a connecting refrigerant circuit  207 , and the refrigerant liquid piping  25  of the heat source unit  2  and the utilization side expanding means V 7  of the utilization units  3  are connected via the connecting refrigerant circuit  207 . Herein, the second refrigerant gas piping  28  is not used because it is not needed for the switchable cooling and heating device.  \\n      In the heat source unit  2  of the air conditioner  201 , the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  conventionally used only as the condenser can also be used as the evaporator. Consequently, it is not necessary in this heat source unit  2  to perform the operation of supplying the refrigerant gas discharged from the compressing means to the first refrigerant gas piping while actuating the main heat exchanger  22  as the condenser, as in the heat source unit for the conventional simultaneous cooling and heating device, and the load of the heat source unit  2  can be regulated by actuating the main heat exchanger  22  as the condenser and actuating the auxiliary heat exchanger  23  as the evaporator. Consequently, the check valve provided in the first refrigerant gas piping of the conventional heat source unit is not needed in this heat source unit  2  (refer to  FIG. 9 ).  \\n      Thereby, the heat source unit  2  of this air conditioner can be used either as the air conditioner for switchable cooling and heating operation or as the air conditioner for simultaneous cooling and heating operation because, in the first refrigerant gas piping  26 , the refrigerant gas from the connecting refrigerant circuit  207  can be flowed to the first switching means V 1 , the refrigerant gas from the first switching means V 1  can be flowed to the connecting refrigerant circuit  207 , and the first refrigerant gas piping  26  can thereby be used as the refrigerant gas piping for the switchable cooling and heating device.  \\n     Fourth Embodiment  \\n       FIG. 10  is a view that depicts the principal components of the refrigerant circuit of an air conditioner  301  according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention.  \\n      In the air conditioner  301 , some of the plurality of utilization units used as switchable cooling and heating devices in the air conditioner  201  of the third embodiment are used as cooling only devices. Herein, the constitution of the heat source unit  2  and the utilization units are the same as that in the third embodiment, but the symbols of the utilization unit including a cooling only device is labeled with the 300 series (i.e., utilization unit  303 ).  \\n      Specifically, in the utilization units  3  excepting the utilization unit  303  including the cooling only device, the first refrigerant gas piping  26  of the heat source unit  2  and the utilization side heat exchangers  32  of the utilization units  3  are connected via a connecting refrigerant circuit  307 , and the refrigerant liquid piping  25  of the heat source unit  2  and the utilization side expanding means V 7  of the utilization units  3  are connected via the connecting refrigerant circuit  307 . However, in the utilization unit  303 , the second refrigerant gas piping  28  of the heat source unit  2  and a utilization side heat exchanger  332  of the utilization unit  303  are connected via the connecting refrigerant circuit  307 , and the refrigerant liquid piping  25  of the heat source unit  2  and a utilization side expanding means V 307  of the utilization unit  303  are connected via the connecting refrigerant circuit  307 . Namely, the air conditioner  301  of the present embodiment differs from the third embodiment in that the utilization unit  303  used as the cooling only device is connected to the second refrigerant gas piping  28  and not the first refrigerant gas piping  26 .  \\n      This air conditioner  301  can perform heating operation of the utilization units  3  and cooling operation of the utilization unit  303 , as in the arrows attached to the refrigerant circuit showing the flow of refrigerant in  FIG. 10 . Specifically, in the utilization units  3 , operation is performed by supplying high pressure refrigerant gas to the utilization side refrigerant circuits  3 a of the utilization units  3  via the first refrigerant gas piping  26 , condensing the refrigerant in the utilization side heat exchangers  32  as well as heating the indoor air, and returning the condensed refrigerant liquid to the refrigerant liquid piping  25 . In the utilization unit  303 , operation is performed by supplying the refrigerant liquid to a utilization side refrigerant circuit  303   a  of the utilization unit  303  via the refrigerant liquid piping  25  or the connecting refrigerant circuit  307 , evaporating the refrigerant in the utilization side heat exchanger  332  as well as cooling the indoor air, and returning the evaporated low pressure refrigerant gas to the second refrigerant gas piping  28 .  \\n      Thus, in the air conditioner  301  of the present embodiment, the connecting units  4  of the first embodiment are not used, and the utilization units  3 ,  303  can perform simultaneous cooling and heating operation; consequently, the valve operation for switching between cooling and heating (e.g., the operation of the valves V 8 , V 9 , and V 10  in the first embodiment) is not needed, and the time for the operation of switching between cooling and heating can be shortened. In addition, the startup time can also be shortened because the operation of valves during startup of the air conditioner  301  can be reduced.  \\n      Furthermore, if the air conditioner is installed in an architectural structure like a building, then the utilization units installed in the server room may be used as the cooling only devices; however, even in such a case, they can be used as cooling only devices capable of continuously performing cooling operation, regardless of the operational state of other utilization units, by just connecting the utilization units to the refrigerant liquid piping  25  and the second refrigerant gas piping  28  of the heat source unit  2  as in the utilization unit  303 .  \\n     Other Embodiments  \\n      The above explained an embodiment of the present invention based on the drawings, but the specific constitution is not limited to these embodiments, and it is understood that variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.  \\n      For example, the first and second embodiments explained the refrigerant circuit of a simultaneous cooling and heating device, but the same effect is obtained even if a switchable cooling and heating device does not include the connecting unit.  \\n     Industrial Field of Application  \\n      By using the present invention, the check valve provided in the first refrigerant gas piping of the heat source unit for the conventional simultaneous cooling and heating device can be eliminated because the second switching means is provided, and the auxiliary heat exchanger can also be actuated as the evaporator. Thereby, a heat source unit can be provided capable of being used in either the air conditioner for switchable cooling and heating operation or the air conditioner for simultaneous cooling and heating operation.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005156687-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The present invention provides a surface acoustic wave device that allows a plurality of surface acoustic wave filters to be formed on a single chip and permits greater miniaturization.

Field of the Invention  \\n      The present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave device and, more particularly, a surface acoustic wave device such as a surface acoustic wave filter.  \\n      2. Description of the Related Art  \\n      Surface acoustic wave devices are used in antenna duplexers of mobile communications devices such as cellular phones. Miniaturization of mobile communication apparatuses and additional miniaturization of surface acoustic wave devices in keeping with the trend toward greater complexity are required.  \\n      In cases where a surface acoustic wave device is used in an antenna duplexer, a transmission surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter and a reception surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter are formed on the same common chip for the sake of miniaturization.  \\n      Here, cases arise where a signal that is inputted by a transmission terminal is converted into a surface acoustic wave by a transmission resonator and a short circuit is formed so that the surface acoustic wave is propagated and linked to the reception resonator. In such a case, the transmission/reception isolation characteristic deteriorates and the filter transmission characteristic is subject to spurious emission.  \\n      As conventional techniques for solving this problem, a technique that provides a groove by means of dicing between two SAW filters on a piezoelectric substrate (Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos. H5-102783 and 2000-13179), or a technique that allows one filter to carry parts that intersect lines that are connected to a signal terminal and lines that are connected to a ground terminal (Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2003-51731), have been disclosed.  \\n      However, in the inventions appearing in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos. H5-102783 and 2000-13179, the fine processing of the processing technology is problematic, there are resonator problems and limitations on placement, and there is the risk of an increase in chip size. In addition, deterioration in the characteristics is induced because chips fly toward the resonator when a groove is provided by means of dicing.  \\n      On the other hand, an object of the invention according to Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2003-51731 is to prevent worsening of the isolation and the attenuation amount caused by reciprocal induction that is produced in order to counteract the magnetic flux that arises due to the influence of the current flowing to the filter.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      Therefore, unlike the object and constitution described in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2003-51731, an object of the present invention is to prevent the occurrence of a short circuit. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a surface acoustic wave device that solves the problems of fine-processing complexity, an increase in chip size, and the production of chipping when a groove is provided by means of dicing, which were problems faced by both the inventions of Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos. H5-102783 and 2000-13179, and that allows a plurality of surface acoustic wave filters to be formed on a single chip and greater miniaturization to be achieved.  \\n      A first aspect of the surface acoustic wave device according to the present invention, which achieves the above object, comprises a piezoelectric substrate;

and  \\n       FIG. 11  is for consideration of the relationship between a cutout of length L and the electrode width of wraparound electrodes EL 1  and EL 2  in the embodiment in  FIG. 10 . \\n    \\n    \\n      As a result of the constitution of the present invention, signal interference between resonators in a common package can be eliminated without forming a groove by means of dicing, whereby it is possible to obtain a surface acoustic wave device that allows a plurality of surface acoustic wave filters to be formed on one chip and permits greater miniaturization.  \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n      Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. The embodiments permit an understanding of the present invention but the technological scope of the present invention is not limited to or by these embodiments.  \\n      Here, prior to the description of the embodiments, the problems to be solved by the present invention will be described in more detail to permit an understanding of the present invention.  \\n       FIG. 1  shows a conventional constitution example of a surface acoustic wave device that functions as an antenna duplexer constituted by two ladder-type surface acoustic wave filters. A transmission signal is applied to a transmission terminal that is denoted by TP in  FIG. 1  and reaches an antenna pad ANT via a transmission filter in which surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators T 1  to T 4  are connected in the form of a ladder.  \\n      In addition, a reception filter, in which SAW resonators R 1  to R 4  are connected in the form of a ladder, is connected to an antenna (not shown) via a phase shifter (not shown).  \\n      The transmission signal reaches the antenna via the transmission filter and is emitted as a radio wave as mentioned earlier, being applied to the reception filter at one end. However, in the transmission frequency band, the band of the reception filter is in the attenuation band, and therefore the transmission signal barely reaches the reception terminal RP that is connected to a receiver low noise amplifier.  \\n      A signal in the reception frequency band is also in the attenuation band in the transmission filter and in the passband in the reception filter. Therefore, a signal received by the antenna arrives at the reception terminal RP via the phase shifter and antenna terminal ANT but barely reaches the transmission terminal TP.  \\n      Here, the isolation characteristic indicates the transmission characteristic according to which a signal inputted from the transmission side is outputted to the reception terminal RP via the transmission SAW resonators T 4 , T 3 , then T 2 , the antenna pad ANT, and then the reception resonators R 1 , R 2 , then R 3 . This transmission characteristic desirably undergoes an attenuation of \\u221250 dB or less.  \\n      However, when the transmission and reception filters exist on the same chip, cases arise where a signal inputted from the transmission side is outputted to the reception terminal RP via a short circuit that includes the transmission resonator T 3 , surface acoustic wave propagation, and then the reception resonator R 3 , or the transmission resonator T 2 , surface acoustic wave propagation, and the reception resonator R 2 . As a result of such a short circuit, the isolation characteristic deteriorates and spurious emission occurs.  \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates spurious emission in the filter characteristic.  FIG. 2A  shows the attenuation characteristic rendered by an insertion loss with respect to the frequency, spurious emission being generated by the formation of the short circuit of the surface acoustic wave in the conventional constitution above in the part circled by a broken line in  FIG. 1 .  FIG. 2B  indicates the extraction of this spurious emission component. The filter characteristics deteriorate as a result of the production of this spurious emission.  \\n      In order to avoid the occurrence of spurious emission caused by the formation of such an acoustic-surface-wave short circuit, conventional countermeasures include one method that forms a groove by means of dicing as shown in  FIG. 3  in order to prevent the propagation of a surface acoustic wave to an adjacent filter as mentioned earlier.  \\n      In  FIG. 3 , a groove  2  is formed in the center of the chip by means of dicing for division in two regions, which are a transmission-side region I and a reception-side region II. The formation of a path along which a surface acoustic wave is short-circuited from a resonator in the transmission-side region I to a resonator in the reception-side region II can thus be prevented as a result of the groove  2 .  \\n      Here, since the minimum width of a groove that is formed by means of dicing and that allows the formation of a short circuit to be prevented is on the order of approximately 50 \\u03bcm, it is not a large impediment to the miniaturization of the chip. However, because the dicing is performed at the center of the chip, this limits the layout of the chip. In addition, there is the problem of the high probability of an effect on the transmission/reception filters caused by chipping of dicing.  \\n      As another method of preventing the formation of a short circuit, a method that involves applying a highly viscous epoxy resin to absorb surface acoustic waves between the transmission and reception filters may be assumed.  FIG. 4  illustrates such a method. An epoxy resin  3  is applied instead of forming a groove  2  between the transmission and reception filters. However, there is the probability of deterioration in the characteristics due to the chemical influence of the epoxy resin. Further, a broad application area is required in order to absorb surface acoustic waves, which makes chip miniaturization problematic.  \\n      Therefore, the present invention resolves the problems of conventional methods of preventing the formation of short-circuiting of a surface acoustic wave.  FIG. 5  is a first embodiment of a surface acoustic wave device to which the present invention is applied.  \\n      A pair of SAW resonators  11  and  12  is formed opposite one another by means of a metallic film such as aluminum or an aluminum alloy on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate  10  of LiTaO 3 , LiNbO 3 , or the like. In addition, a metallic film  4  is formed between the SAW resonators  11  and  12 .  \\n      The SAW resonators  11  and  12  each have a different frequency characteristic in the surface acoustic wave device that corresponds with the intended usage of the surface acoustic wave device. In addition, the positions in which the SAW resonators  11  and  12  are formed on the piezoelectric substrate  10  are in an at least partially overlapping relationship in a surface acoustic wave propagation region that is defined by virtually extending the respective openings of the SAW resonators  11  and  12 . These requirements are also the same in the embodiments described hereinbelow.  \\n      As a result of this partially overlapping relationship, the width within which the surface acoustic wave  5  propagated from the SAW resonator  11  is received by the SAW resonator  12 , that is, the width of overlap with the electrode of the SAW resonator  12 , is guided, this width being \\u2018M\\u2019.  \\n      The metallic film  4  provided between the SAW resonators  11  and  12  is provided with a cutout of length L in a part corresponding to the width M/2, which is the upper half of the width of the overlap of the electrode with the SAW resonator  12 . As a result of this electrode cutout of width M/2 and length L, a phase difference is produced for the surface acoustic wave  5  that is inputted to the SAW resonator  12 , between the upper half portion SAW-U and lower-half SAW-D of width M of the surface acoustic wave  5 .  \\n      That is, supposing that the velocity in the lower region of the metallic film  4  is Vm, the velocity in the region without the metallic film  4  is Vf, where f is the drive frequency, in the event of a cutout length L that fulfils the condition,  \\n                 L   /   Vm     -     L   /   Vf       =       (       2   \\u2062   n     +   1     )     /     (     2   *   f     )               Equation   \\u2062     \\u2003     \\u2062   1                   \\u2192   L     =     Vm   *   Vf   *       (       2   \\u2062   n     +   1     )     /     (     2   *     (     Vf   -   Vm     )     *   f     )           \\u2062     \\u2003             \\u2003                 \\u2003     \\u2062     (       n   =   1     ,     2   \\u2062     \\u2003     \\u2062   \\u2026       \\u2062     \\u2003     )             \\u2003             \\n \\n the upper-half surface acoustic wave SAW-U and lower-half surface acoustic wave SAW-D, which arrive at the SAW resonator  12  of the propagated surface acoustic wave  5 , possess a phase difference that is an odd multiple of the half wavelength of the surface acoustic wave. \\n \\n      The surface acoustic wave SAW-U and surface acoustic wave SAW-Dare antiphase to each other. Therefore, because the phases of the upper-half surface acoustic wave SAW-U and lower-half surface acoustic wave SAW-D of the surface acoustic wave  5  that reaches the SAW resonator  12  facing the SAW resonator  11  are antiphase to each other, the two waves SAW-U and SAW-D offset each other, meaning that a spurious signal is no longer received by the SAW resonator  12 . As a result, the spurious signal can be reduced.  \\n       FIG. 6  is a second embodiment of the present invention. In  FIG. 6 , the same reference numerals have been assigned to the same elements as those of the first embodiment in  FIG. 5 . As per  FIG. 5 , the SAW resonators  11  and  12  are placed on the piezoelectric substrate  10 .  \\n      The embodiment shown in  FIG. 6  is a constitution in which a part that corresponds to a cutout equivalent to the width M/2 and length L of the metallic film  4  of the embodiment in  FIG. 5  is reversely made the metallic film  41 . Electrode is not formed between the SAW resonators  11  and  12  in other parts.  \\n      Even where the embodiment is as shown in  FIG. 6 , due to the existence of the metallic film  41 , a phase difference is produced between the upper-half surface acoustic wave SAW-U and the lower-half surface acoustic wave SAW-D of the surface acoustic wave  5  propagated by the SAW resonator  11  that arrives at the SAW resonator  12 . Accordingly, similarly also with this embodiment, because the phases of the upper-half surface acoustic wave SAW-U and the lower-half surface acoustic wave SAW-D are antiphase to each other, the two waves offset each other, meaning that a spurious signal is no longer received by the SAW resonator  12 . As a result, the spurious signal can be reduced as per the embodiment in  FIG. 5 .  \\n      The foregoing embodiments are examples in which a surface acoustic wave propagation region, which is defined by virtually extending the respective openings of the first SAW resonator  11  and second SAW resonator  12 , is divided into an upper-half region and a lower-half region. The present invention further divides the overlap surface acoustic wave propagation regions into a plurality of regions and is also able to afford the phases of surface acoustic waves propagated by the SAW resonator  11  an antiphase relationship in the upper-half regions and lower-half regions of these divided regions.  \\n       FIG. 7  is a third embodiment of the present invention in which an overlap surface acoustic wave propagation region is divided into two regions and the phases of surface acoustic waves are afforded an antiphase relationship to each other in the upper-half region and lower-half region of each of these divided regions.  \\n      In  FIG. 7 , the same reference numerals have been assigned to the same constituent elements as those of the above embodiment. As per the embodiment in  FIG. 6 , the resonators  11  and  12  are placed on a piezoelectric substrate  10 . In addition, a metallic film  41  of width M/2 and length L, which is disposed between the SAW resonators  11  and  12  of the embodiment in  FIG. 6 , is further divided into metallic films  411  and  412  of width M/4.  \\n      As a result of this constitution, two metallic films  411  and  412  of width M/4 and length L exist between the SAW resonators  11  and  12 , and the surface acoustic wave  5  propagated by the SAW resonator  11  is separated into surface acoustic waves SAW-UL and U 2 , which are propagated over the metallic films  411  and  412 , and surface acoustic waves SAW-DL and D 2 , which are propagated via parts without electrode.  \\n      Therefore, the surface acoustic waves SAW-U 1  and U 2 , which are propagated over the metallic films  411  and  412 , and surface acoustic waves SAW-D 1  and D 2 , which are propagated via parts without electrode, are antiphase to each other and, when propagated to the SAW resonator  12 , the surface acoustic waves SAW-U 1  and D 1  and SAW-U 2  and D 2  counteract one another such that the SAW resonator  12  does not receive a spurious signal. As a result, the spurious signal can be reduced.  \\n       FIG. 8  is yet another embodiment of the present invention. In  FIG. 8 , the same reference numerals have been assigned to the same constituent elements as those of the embodiment above. As per each of the above embodiments, the SAW resonators  11  and  12  are disposed facing one another on the piezoelectric substrate  10 . A characteristic of this embodiment is that the opening width of part of the reflector  13  of the SAW resonator  11  facing the SAW resonator  12  is made half. That is, N reflector part electrodes  13 - 1  among a plurality of electrodes that constitute the reflector  13  have half the width of the others.  \\n      The length of the width of the reflector part  13 - 1 , which is half the electrode length of the reflector  13 , is made equal to the length L of each of the above embodiments (the length L of the cutout of the electrode disposed between the resonators  11  and  12  of embodiment 1, and the length L of the electrode disposed between the resonators  11  and  12  in embodiments 2 and 3).  \\n      That is, for the reflector  13  with the length \\u03bb/4, by halving the opening width of the reflector part  13 - 1 , the length of N of which satisfies: \\n      4*N/\\u03bb=Vm*Vf*(2 n+1)/(2*(Vf\\u2212Vm)*f) (n=1, 2, . . . ), the same action and effects are obtained as those of the above embodiment, where Vm is the velocity of a part with the reflector electrodes and Vf is the velocity of a part without reflector electrodes.    \\n\\n      For a surface acoustic wave emitted by the reflector  13 , an acoustic velocity differential and a phase difference are produced between part SAW-D, in which the N reflector partial electrodes  13 - 1  are not present, and part SAW-U, which has these partial electrodes.  \\n      Therefore, surface acoustic wave SAW-U and surface acoustic wave SAW-D counteract each other and the SAW resonator  12  does not receive a spurious signal. As a result, the spurious signal can be reduced.  \\n       FIG. 9  is a graph showing the effect of each of the above embodiments, the frequency (MHz) being plotted on the horizontal axis and the insertion loss (dB) being plotted on the vertical axis. As is evident from a comparison with  FIG. 2 , it can be seen that spurious emission is reduced by the present invention.  \\n       FIG. 10  is an embodiment in which the present invention is also applied to a surface acoustic wave device that functions as an antenna duplexer constituted by two ladder-type surface acoustic wave filters.  \\n      A transmission signal is applied to the transmission terminal TP in  FIG. 10  and reaches the antenna pad ANT via a transmission filter in which surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators T 1  to T 4  are connected in the form of a ladder.  \\n      In addition, a reception filter, in which SAW resonators R 1  to R 4  are connected in the form of a ladder, is connected to an antenna (not shown) via a phase shifter (not shown).  \\n      Here, in the constitution shown in  FIG. 10 , a surface acoustic wave propagation path generated by SAW resonators T 2  and T 3  of the transmission filter and the positions of the SAW resonators R 2  and R 3  of the reception filter overlap one another. There is therefore the possibility of a short circuit being formed between the surface acoustic wave propagation path and SAW resonators R 2  and R 3  for the surface acoustic wave between the transmission and reception filters.  \\n      In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 10 , in order to avoid this short-circuit formation, cutouts  101  and  102  of length L and width M/2 are formed in wraparound electrodes EL 1  and EL 2  that are formed between the transmission filter and reception filter as per the constitution in  FIG. 5 . As a result, according to the same principle described in  FIG. 5 , it is possible to avoid short-circuit coupling of a surface acoustic wave generated by the SAW resonators T 2  and T 3  of the transmission filter with the SAW resonators R 2  and R 3  of the reception filter. It can be seen that spurious emission can also be reduced in this manner in the embodiment of  FIG. 10 .  \\n       FIG. 11  is for consideration of the relationship between a cutout of length L that is formed in the wraparound electrodes EL 1  and EL 2  and the electrode width of the wraparound electrodes EL 1  and EL 2  in the embodiment in  FIG. 10 .  \\n      When a cutout, the length L of which is smaller than the electrode width of the wraparound electrode EL 1  (same is true for EL 2 ) that is shown partially enlarged on the right-hand side of  FIG. 11 , is formed, supposing that, in Equation 1, Vm=4113.3 (m/s), Vf=4210.3 (m/s), and f=800 MHz, this gives:  \\n             L   =     4113.3   *   4210.3   *     0.5   /     (     800   *   97   *   106     )       \\u2062     \\u2003     \\u2062     (   m   )                   =       111   *   10     -     6   \\u2062     \\u2003     \\u2062     (   m   )                     =     111   \\u2062     \\u2003     \\u2062       (   \\u00b5m   )     .                 \\n \\n      Therefore, a cutout of length L can be formed in the wraparound electrode without changing the electrode width that is used in the chip of the duplexer of the communication apparatus that is used in mobile-communication frequency bands that are employed currently.  \\n      According to the present invention, the unnecessary coupling of a surface acoustic wave between a plurality of SAW resonators mounted in a common package can be avoided without the need to form a groove between the SAW resonators or to provide an acoustic-surface-wave absorbent. As a result, a surface acoustic wave device that eliminates unnecessary spurious emission in the filter characteristic and that permits miniaturization of the device can be provided, and hence the contribution to the industry is substantial.  \\n      Moreover, although a one port-type SAW resonator was described in the above embodiment, the application of the present invention is not limited to such a case. That is, a plurality of IDT (comb-shaped electrode converters) is placed in the direction of propagation of the surface acoustic wave according to the application of the present invention, and it can be easily seen that analogous action is obtained with a 2-port-type SAW resonator and DMS (multimode filter) on the two sides of which a grating reflector is provided.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005159216-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A simulation game system and a Geographical Information System (GIS) are associated to provide realistic game backgrounds in real-time.

Field of Invention  \\n      The present invention relates to a simulation game system and method, and more particularly to simulation game system and method that associate with a Geographical Information System (GIS) to create game backgrounds in real-time and provide geographical information.  \\n      2. Related Art  \\n      Simulation games are currently very popular and attract many players in their virtual game world.  \\n      A very important aspect of simulation games is the creation of the game background. The creation of a game background usually necessitates the consideration of several aspects: \\n          (1) The game background has to be realistic to attract the player over a long interval of time, so that she/he feels completely immerged in the simulated world of the game.     (2) The game background has to be switched smoothly. Because the course of a game usually requires a great amount of different backgrounds, the way of creating and displaying the background dynamically constitutes an essential factor to the continuity of the game.        \\n\\n      Current techniques generally call for the assembly of graphics to form the game backgrounds. In other words, available graphics are differently associated to form different backgrounds of the game. Though this technique is easily and widely implemented, it requires the storage of a great amount of graphic data and is not suitable for the background level of detail. Other disadvantages of the technique of the prior art include non-realism of the background adjustment and slow and resource-consuming generation of the game background.  \\n      On the other hand, another important aspect of a simulation game is the interaction between game and player. Generally, successful simulation games are those that can achieve highly interactive events and can continuously attract and interest the player in the course of the game without being bored. Unfortunately, present simulation games have limited abilities to exhibit interactive events.  \\n      Therefore, there is a need for a new simulation game design that can improve the quality of the game and the interactivity with the player, so that the simulation game is more attractive.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      It is therefore an objective of the invention to provide a simulation game system and method that can overcome the disadvantages of the prior art by integrating a Geographical Information System therein.  \\n      According to an aspect of the invention, vector layer data and grid layer data provided by the Geographical Information System are combined with the background objects and overlay computing will be carried out, so as to create more realistic and precise game backgrounds.  \\n      According to another aspect of the invention, game events are combined with geographical information provided by the Geographical Information System, so that the player can obtain actual and adequate information to adopt appropriate strategies or to make right decisions.  \\n      To accomplish the above and other objectives, a simulation game system of the invention comprises a manipulation-displaying module, a logic computing module, a Geographical Information System, a game database, and a background generator module.  \\n      According to other aspects of the invention, a simulation game method is provided. The simulation game method comprises: \\n          (1) The background generating process, including the following steps. First of all, a move signal is detected when a game character move, the game character&#39;s coordinate data will be computed and created based on the detected result. Secondly, a display area corresponding to the game character coordinate data is delivered and map layer data are accessed. Thirdly, according to coordinates of the display area and vector layer data, a first map overlay computing is performed. After this, according to the coordinates of the display area and grid layer data, a second map overlay computing is performed. Then, background object data are read in the display area and a game background is created. Finally, the game background is displayed in real-time.     (2) The interacting process in a game, including the following steps. A trigger signal first is detected and corresponding event coordinate data are generated. Event coordinate data corresponding to the trigger signal then are outputted. If the event coordinate data correspond to a geographical information event, geographical information corresponding to the event coordinate data is retuned via the Geographical Information System. Lastly, the display is updated.        \\n\\n      Because the invention does not use the assembly of graphics, prior problems such as graphics storage and resource consuming can be prevented, while the functionality of free levels of details can be provided in the simulation game. By combining geographical information and game events, the invention further can improve the game interactivity and realism.  \\n      Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.  \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow illustration only, and is thus not limitative of the present invention, wherein:  \\n       FIG. 1  is a block diagram of a simulation game system integrating geographical information according to an embodiment of the invention;  \\n       FIG. 2  is a flowchart of a background generating process implemented in a simulation game system and method according to an embodiment of the invention;  \\n       FIG. 3  is a flowchart of a geographical information accessing process implemented in a simulation game system method according to an embodiment of the invention;  \\n       FIG. 4  is a schematic view illustrating a game background creation in a simulation game system and method integrating geographical information according to an embodiment of the invention; and  \\n       FIG. 5  through  FIG. 7  are schematic views of a geographical information analysis and display implemented in a simulation game system and method according to an embodiment of the invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The invention describes a simulation game system and method that incorporates geographical data. A geographical information database  125  of a geographical information system  120  provides geographical information. Geographical information differs from usual data provided by a conventional management information system, and includes spatial data with specific attributes as well as topological relations. Map layer data can be thereby displayed and geographical information can be subjected to inquiry and analysis. Geographical Information System is generally known in the field of computer science, and per se do not constitute the subject of the invention.  \\n      The success of simulation games generally resides in aspects such as realism, continuity, and interactivity. However, current techniques generally do not allow obtaining satisfactory results of these basic requirements. A major aspect of the invention is therefore to associate a Geographical Information System  120  with a simulation game system, so that while the game is being played, the Geographical Information System  120  can provide map layer data to build a more realistic game background. Events occurring in the course of the game may be further associated with geographical information so as to improve the game interactivity, and thereby overcome some of the prior problems of simulation games.  \\n       FIG. 1  is a block diagram of a simulation game system according to an embodiment of the invention. The system includes a manipulation-displaying module  100 , a logic computing module  110 , a geographical information system  120 , a background generating module  130 , and a game database  140 .  \\n      The manipulation-displaying module  100  receives a manipulating action from the player. Manipulating actions generally can be divided into game characters moves and game triggering events, which respectively produce move signals and trigger signals.  \\n      Move signals mean that a game character(s) is moving and, therefore, the environmental background surrounding the moving character(s) has to be updated and redisplayed. On the other hand, trigger signals mean that a game character(s) enters a predetermined game event, including a game course event or a geographical information event. Therefore, the game course has to be executed.  \\n      The logic-computing module  110  performs fast logic computing and signal category evaluation. When a move signal is received, the logic-computing module  110  computes the coordinate data of the current game character in movement and determines a corresponding display area. The display area usually corresponds to a maximal visible area from the current position coordinates of the game character.  \\n      When a trigger signal is received, the logic-computing module  110  performs logic computing of corresponding event coordinate data, as well as signal evaluation. According to the location of the event coordinate data: if it is determined that the trigger signal relates to a game course event, the event coordinate data are transferred via the background generating module  130  to the game database  140  so as to read and execute a predetermined game course sequence. In contrast, if it is determined that the trigger signal corresponds to a geographical information event, the event coordinate data are transferred via the geographical information system  120  to the geographical information database  125  so as to access corresponding geographical information.  \\n      The Geographical Information System  120  provides map layer information such as vector layer data, grid layer data, etc., corresponding to the display area outputted from the logic-computing module  110 . Furthermore, the Geographical Information System  120  provides a geographical information analysis corresponding to event coordinate data outputted from the logic-computing module  110 .  \\n      All map layer data and geographical information are stored in the geographical information database  125 , being connected to the Geographical Information System  120 . In addition, the map layer data and geographical information respectively correspond to preset event coordinate data.  \\n      The background generator module  130  receives map layer data from the Geographical Information System  120  to perform overlay computing and form a game background.  \\n      Overlay computing means that the vector layer data and the grid layer data of the map layer data are overlaid according to coordinate data, a 3-dimentions game background will be created based on the layer contents. Furthermore, the game background may include background objects data preset in the display areas.  \\n      The background generator module  130  additionally executes a game course sequence corresponding to event coordinate data transmitted from the logic-computing module  110 .  \\n      The game database  140  stores game course sequences corresponding to event coordinate data and background object data corresponding to display areas.  \\n       FIG. 2  is a flowchart of a game background generating method according to an embodiment of the invention. At the start and in the course of the game, character(s) may continuously move and therefore require the generation of game backgrounds. Therefore, move signals from the player&#39;s manipulation are continuously detected, and character coordinate data of the current character&#39;s position are calculated in real-time (step  200 ). A display area corresponding to the character coordinate data is transmitted to access to map layer data (step  210 ). During step  210 , the maximal visible area around the game character is determined and used as principal reference for accessing to corresponding map layer data during the background creation. According to the display area data and the vector layer data, the first map overlay computing is performed (step  220 ). At step  220 , vector layer data according to their coordinates are displayed on the display area. According to the display area coordinates and the grid layer data, the second map overlay computing then is performed (step  230 ). At step  230 , grid layer data according to their coordinates are displayed on the display area. Background objects data of the display area then are read, and a game background is created ( 240 ). At step  240 , background objects data preset as being positioned in the display area are actually placed in the display area, and a 3-dimensions game background, incorporating vector layer data, grid layer data, and background object data is formed. Lastly, the game background is displayed on the current display area of the game character (step  250 ).  \\n       FIG. 4  is a flowchart of a overlay computing method implemented in an embodiment of the invention. Via this method, the created game background is more realistic, and the background generating can be more efficient.  \\n      Now reference is made to  FIG. 3  that describes a flowchart of a geographical information accessing method according to an embodiment of the invention. The invention integrates the Geographical Information System  120  in the game course so that the player can access in real-time to geographical information used for game strategy reference, which thereby can improve interaction with the player.  \\n      A game usually includes preset events that can be triggered by the player during the game process. Therefore trigger signals are continuously detected in the game (step  300 ). The generation of trigger signals can come from automatic comparing detections of character coordinate data or player manipulation actions. After the trigger action is determined, event coordinate data corresponding to the trigger signal are delivered (step  310 ). Events can be classified into game course events and geographical information events. Accordingly, it is determined whether the position of the event coordinate data corresponds to a game course event (step  320 ). If so, the background generator module  130  reads and executes game course sequence(s) stored in the game database (step  330 ). After the game course sequence has been executed, the display is updated (step  360 ). If the position of the event coordinate data otherwise corresponds to a geographical information event, the logic computing module  110  transfers the event coordinate data to the Geographical Information System  120 , to access corresponding geographical information which then are fed back to the game (step  340 ). The display accordingly is updated (step  360 ). If event coordinate data of a trigger signal do not correspond to either a game course event or a geographical information event, it means that the trigger signal is invalid. At this time, the flow returns to step  300  to continue detecting trigger signals.  \\n       FIG. 5  through  FIG. 7  are schematic views illustrating a geographical information analysis and display according to an embodiment of the invention. In the example of  FIG. 5 , if the player triggers a \\u201clake\\u201d geographical information event in the game background, the game displays geographical information relating to the triggered \\u201clake\\u201d including general information (such as the water quality, the water volume, depth, etc.), analysis information (such as the shortest path or range of influence). The player thereby can choose proper strategy or make correct decision, this extremely enhances the game&#39;s sense of reality.  \\n      In the example of  FIG. 6 , if the player triggers a preset location A in the game background and desires to establish a factory at this location, geographical information relating to a buffer zone is analyzed with respect to the location A. An optimal buffer zone then is suggested to the player for building the desired factory (as shown by the encircled zone in the figure). In addition, further detailed information can be provided to the player about possible environmental factors and events that may occur after the factory has been completed, so that the player can decide whether the factory ultimately should be set up in the buffer zone.  \\n      In the example of  FIG. 7 , if the player triggers preset locations A, B in the game background and desires to create a road between A and B, a route analysis is performed about geographical information relating to the construction of a road between A and B. Different routes then may be proposed to the player for the road (as shown by dotted lines in the figure). The player further may be informed of advantages and disadvantages corresponding to each situation. According to the current environmental configuration and available resource in the game process, the player thereby can be guided to choose the road to be created. As a result, geographical information therefore can be advantageously associated into the simulation game.  \\n      As described above, in addition to basic geographical information display, the geographical analysis can include aspects such as analyses of buffer zones or pathways, but may include other aspects such as analyses of the space topology, slope inclination, 3D views, tendency forecast, etc. All these and other aspects can be integrated in a simulation game according to the invention so as to improve the game interactivity and realism.  \\n      It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that the invention as described above may be varied in many ways, and notwithstanding remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005165502-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A method of processing an audio stream comprises receiving a digital audio stream and automatically determining the received digital audio stream comprises a single channel of audio data and automatically generating a multi-channel audio stream having at least two audio channels each comprising the single channel of audio data.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"1 .

An optical storage device, e.g., a digital versatile disc (DVD), is a desirable storage medium due to the permanence of the optic disc. Additionally, DVDs offer a better viewing experience than analog playback devices. For example, video and audio stored on a DVD is randomly accessible and has attractive search options not available on various analog and digital tape formats used by most camcorders and video cassette recorders (VCRs). Additionally, storage of video and audio on a digital storage device provides exact reproduction from copy to copy.  \\n      The majority of home movies recorded by camcorders are stored on various analog storage media, e.g., video tapes such as VHS, 8 mm, hi-8, VHS-C, and the like. When transferring analog video and audio to a digital medium such as an optic storage disc, the analog source is first converted to a digital signal. Specialized hardware often referred to as a capture or compression card is used for the analog-to-digital conversion. The digital signal output by the capture card is supplied to mastering software that is used to write the digitized video and audio to the digital medium.  \\n      Many older video cassette recorders and analog camcorders have a single channel audio-out port. When such a device is interconnected with a capture or compression card for converting the analog video and audio signals into a digital format, a single channel of audio signals is recorded to the optic medium. Often, the user is not aware that such a problem exists until playback of the optic disc results in a single channel of monophonic audio emitted from a single speaker channel of the playback audio system. To avoid a single channel monophonic playback, the user must use a splitter cable to duplicate the single channel audio and supply the split audio signals into a respective right and left channel of the capture card.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      A method of processing an audio stream comprises receiving a digital audio stream and automatically determining the received digital audio stream comprises a single channel of audio data and automatically generating a multi-channel audio stream having at least two audio channels each comprising the single channel of audio data.  \\n      A system, comprising an analog-to-digital conversion device adapted to receive an analog signal and convert the analog signal into a digital signal, and an analysis application adapted to automatically determine the digital signal comprises a monophonic audio signal and generate a multi-channel signal having at least two audio channels each comprising the monophonic audio signal.  \\n      In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, a computer-readable medium is provided having stored thereon an instruction set to be executed, the instruction set, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to receive a digital signal comprising monophonic audio data. The processor generates an audio signal having at least two audio channels each comprising the monophonic audio data. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      For a more complete understanding of the present invention, the objects and advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:  \\n       FIG. 1  is a simplified block diagram of a system for processing an analog video/audio signal according to embodiments of the invention;  \\n       FIGS. 2A and 2B  are, respectively, a diagrammatic illustration of a digitized audio stream supplied to an analysis application by an analog-to-digital conversion device, and a multi-channel audio stream generated by the analysis application in accordance with embodiments of the invention;  \\n       FIGS. 2C and 2D  are, respectively, a diagrammatic illustration of a digitized audio stream supplied to an analysis application, and a multi-channel audio stream generated by the analysis application in accordance with embodiments of the invention; and  \\n       FIG. 3  is a simplified block diagram of a computer system operable to execute an analysis application for generating a multi-channel audio stream from an analog, monophonic audio signal in accordance with embodiments of the invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      The preferred embodiment of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to  FIGS. 1 through 3  of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.  \\n       FIG. 1  is a simplified block diagram of a system  50  for processing an analog video and audio (V/A) signal in accordance with embodiments of the invention. An analog device  10 , e.g., a video cassette recorder, an analog camcorder, or another device, is interconnected with a capture card  20 . Capture card  20  comprises a video-in port  21  and right (R) and left (L) audio-in ports  22  and  23 . In the illustrative example, a video-out port  11  of analog device  10  is interconnected with video-in port  21  of capture card  20  by a cable  15 , e.g., a coaxial cable. An audio-out port  12  of analog device  10  is interconnected with one of audio-in ports  22  and  23  of capture card  20  by a cable  16 , e.g., a coaxial cable, a 3.5 mm audio cable, or another suitable transmission medium.  \\n      Capture card  20  is typically implemented as a daughter card that interfaces with an expansion slot, e.g., a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) interface, of a personal computer backplane, e.g., a motherboard. In general, capture card  20  comprises a graphics chipset  27  for converting an analog video signal, e.g., a video signal formatted according to the national television standards committee (NTSC) format, the phase alternating line (PAL) format, or another suitable format, supplied at port  21  and outputting a corresponding digital video signal over a video-out interface  24 . Video-out interface  24  may comprise one or more pins interfacing with an expansion slot of a host computer. Video and audio-out interfaces  24  and  25  may be implemented as a single V/A-out interface, e.g., one or more pins, and the digitized video and audio signals may be interleaved and output over the single V/A-out interface. Similarly, capture card  20  comprises an audio chipset  28  for converting analog audio received at ports  22  and/or  23  and outputting a corresponding digital audio signal over an audio-out interface  25 . In general, audio chipset  28  comprises encoding logic adapted to receive an analog right channel audio signal and an analog left channel audio signal over right and left audio-in ports  22  and  23 , respectively, and encode the received audio signals into a digital audio signal such as a moving pictures experts group (MPEG) audio stream. Graphics chipset  27  functionality and audio chipset  28  functionality may, alternatively, be integrated into a single chipset.  \\n      In the illustrative example, capture card  20  is adapted to convey digital video and audio signals from respective chipsets  27  and  28  to an analysis application  60  for further processing and formatting into a format suitable for storage on a digital medium such as a DVD in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In the illustrative example, application  60  comprises an audio analysis module  61  and a stream conversion module  62 . Analysis application  60  is preferably implemented as a computer-readable instruction set comprising logic for analyzing a digital audio stream and evaluating whether monophonic audio data is present in the audio stream. In the event that monophonic audio data is present in the audio stream, analysis application  60  generates a multi-channel audio stream by duplicating the audio data and inserting the original audio data first into a first audio channel and a copy of the audio data into a second audio channel of the generated audio stream.  \\n      In the illustrative example, analog device  10  comprises a single audio-out port  12  interconnected with right channel audio-in port  22 . No audio signal is supplied to left channel audio-in port  23 . Accordingly, audio chipset  28  produces a monophonic audio stream and conveys the stream to analysis application  60 . In general, a monophonic audio stream supplied to analysis application  60  comprises a digital audio stream having a single channel of audio data. The monophonic audio stream may have additional audio channels with no audio content present. In the absence of an audio signal supplied to an audio-in port, e.g., left audio-in port  23 , corresponding left channel data of the digitized audio signal output from capture card  20  is nulled or absent. Analysis application  60  generates a multi-channel audio stream with duplicated audio signals for at least two audio channels and supplies the generated stream to a mastering software  30  application. In general, mastering software  30  application comprises a computer-readable instruction set comprising logic for formatting the received digital video and audio signals into a format suitable for storage on an optic disc, and for playback from an optic storage player device. For example, mastering software  30  may format the received video and audio streams into a video object comprising video and audio suitable for storage on a DVD on a writeable optic disc drive  40  and for playback on a DVD player.  \\n      Capture card  20  may compress the digital video and audio signals prior to conveying the video and audio to mastering software  30 . Preferably, audio chipset  28  encodes the audio signal in, for example, an MPEG audio layer such as MPEG  1 , MPEG  2 , or MPEG  2 . 5 , or another compressed format. In general, the digital audio signal output by capture card  20  comprises a digitally-encoded audio stream having a sequence of frames. In  FIG. 2A , there is an exemplary diagrammatic illustration of a digital audio stream  200  supplied to analysis application  60  by capture card  20  in accordance with the configuration of system  50  shown in  FIG. 1 . Audio stream  200  comprises a series of right (R) and left (L) channel audio frames  210 - 213 . Each frame  210 - 213  comprises a respective header  201 - 204  and information field  205 - 208 . In the illustrative example, right and left channel audio frames are interleaved in audio stream  200 . Particularly, frames  210  and  212  are designated as right (R) channel frames and frames  211  and  213  are designated as left (L) channel frames. Designation of frames  210 - 213  as a right or left channel frame is made, for example, by a respective bit sequence included in header  201 - 204 . In the illustrative example, right channel frames  210  and  212  comprise respective audio data (audio 1  and audio 2 ) in information fields  205  and  207 , and left channel frames  211  and  213  do not have any audio data. That is, information fields  206  and  208  are nulled by, for example, a bit sequence indicating the absence of audio content. Alternatively, left channel frames  211  and  213  may comprise only headers  202  and  204 .  \\n      In accordance with embodiments of the invention, analysis module  61  comprises logic for analyzing audio stream  200  and determining that monophonic audio content is present. In the illustrative example, analysis module  61  comprises logic for determining the absence of audio content within one or more of frames  210 - 213 . For example, analysis module  61  may read the contents of information fields  205 - 208 , or a portion thereof, and determine the presence of a null bit sequence within fields  206  and  208 . Additionally, analysis module  61  may evaluate headers  202  and  204  to determine that nulled information fields  206  and  208  comprise left channel information fields.  \\n      Upon determining that left channel audio is absent from audio stream  200 , conversion module  62  generates a multi-channel audio stream  220  comprising right channel frames  230  and  232  and left channel frames  231  and  233  as shown by the diagrammatic illustration of multi-channel audio stream  220  in  FIG. 2B . Audio stream  220  is generated by reading the audio data (audio 1 ) of information field  205  and writing the audio data to fields  225  and  226  of generated audio stream  220 . Frame  230  is designated as a right channel audio frame, e.g., by writing a bit sequence or other indicator into a header  221  of frame  230 , and frame  231  is designated as a left channel audio frame in a similar manner. Likewise, the audio data (audio 2 ) read from field  207  is written to fields  227  and  228  of stream  220  of respective frames  232  and  233 . Frames  232  and  233  are designated as right and left channel frames by writing an appropriate bit sequence in respective headers  223  and  224 . It should be apparent that audio stream  220  may be generated by modification of audio stream  200 . For example, audio stream  200  may be converted to a multi-channel audio stream by inserting a frame adjacent to each frame determined to comprise monophonic audio data and copying the monophonic audio data into the inserted frame. Other techniques may be implemented for generation of multi-channel audio stream  220  as will be recognized by those skilled in the art. Stream  220  is then passed to mastering software  30  for preparation of writing to a digital storage medium.  \\n      While the exemplary embodiment described with reference to  FIGS. 2A and 2B  describes audio stream  200  formatted for interleaving left and right channel frames with the audio stream, analysis module  61  may be adapted to analyze any stream format now known or later developed for monophonic audio content. For example, capture card  20  may output a digital audio stream  240  in which single frames carry one or more channel data as shown in the diagrammatic illustration of  FIG. 2C . Audio stream  240  is generally formatted according to the well-known MPEG audio compression format. Particularly, audio stream  240  comprises a series of audio frames  250 - 251  respectively comprising a header  241  and  242  and information field  243  and  244 . Headers  241  and  242  provide an indication, e.g., a bit sequence, that indicates the audio-type of content in a subsequent information field  243  and  244 , respectively. For example, an MPEG-formatted audio stream comprises a 2-bit filed within headers  241  and  242  that indicates a channel mode. TABLE A summarizes channel mode bit patters within an MPEG-formatted audio stream.  \\n                   TABLE A                       Bit-pattern   Channel Mode                  00   Stereo       01   Joint Stereo (Stereo)       10   Dual Channel (Stereo)       11   Single Channel (Mono)                  \\n \\n      The illustrative audio stream  240  in  FIG. 2C  comprises a series of frames  250  and  251  each having a respective information field  243  and  244  having right channel audio data (audio 1  (R) and audio 2 (R)). Headers  241  and  242  include a bit pattern, e.g., a bit pattern of \\u201c11\\u201d, that indicates the audio content within the frame is monophonic. That is, the audio data of frames  250  and  251  comprises single channel audio data. Analysis module  61  is adapted to evaluate audio stream  240  and determine that single channel audio is included therein. For example, analysis module  61  reads headers  241  and  242  and evaluates the channel mode bit sequence for an indication of monophonic audio content. In the illustrative example, the audio content (audio 1 (R) and audio 2 (R)) of each information field  243  and  244  is copied by conversion module  62  in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The copied data is interleaved as left channel audio data with the original right channel audio data of information fields  63  and  264  of a generated multi-channel audio stream  260  as shown by the diagrammatic illustration of  FIG. 2D . The original audio data (audio 1 (R) and audio 2 (R)) constitutes right channel audio data of stream  260  and the copied audio data (audio 1 (L) and audio 2 (L)) constitutes left channel audio data of stream  260 . Preferably, conversion module  62  writes a bit sequence within headers  261  and  262  that indicates audio stream  260  comprises multi-channel audio content. In the illustrative example, conversion module  62  writes a bit pattern of \\u201c00\\u201d in headers  261  and  262  thus indicating respective frames  270  and  271  comprise stereo content. Accordingly, a decoder, e.g., a DVD player having a decoder adapted to playback stream  260  (or a derivation thereof), identifies audio steam  260  as comprising multi-channel audio content and playback results in audible output from multiple channels from a multi-channel stereo system.  \\n       FIG. 3  is a simplified block diagram of a computer system  300  operable to execute analysis application  60  in accordance with embodiments of the invention. System  300  comprises one or more conventional processing elements  330  such as a central processing unit (CPU) connected to a memory and input/output controller (MIOC)  310  via a system bus  335 . Processing element  330  communicates with and drives the other elements within system  300  via a local interface  350 , which may comprise one or more busses. MIOC  310  receives access requests over system bus  335  and addresses a memory device  340  and/or other input/output (I/O) devices communicatively coupled with local interface  350 . For example, a display device  320 , a pointer device (such as a mouse  321 ), a keyboard  322 , an I/O port  323 , and a storage device  324  are communicatively coupled with MIOC  310  via local interface  350 . Memory device  340  may be implemented as a non-volatile storage, such as a read only memory (ROM), a volatile storage, such as a random-access memory (RAM), a dynamic random-access memory, a flash electrically-erasable programmable read only memory, or another storage device. System  300  stores application  60  in storage device  324 . A writeable optic disc drive  40 , e.g., a writeable compact disc drive or a writeable digital versatile disc drive, is communicatively coupled with processing element  330 .  \\n      Through conventional techniques, analysis application  60  and/or mastering software  30  application are fetched from storage device  324 , loaded in memory device  340 , and executed by an operating system (O/S)  345  and processing element  330 . Operating system  345  controls the resources of system  300  through conventional techniques and interfaces the instructions of application  60  with processing element  330  as necessary to enable application  60  to properly run. However, it should be noted that analysis application  60  and mastering software  30  may be located remotely from one another and may reside on different computing platforms.  \\n      An adapter interface  360 , for example a peripheral component interconnect, an integrated drive electronics (IDE) interface, a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), or another peripheral interface, is interconnected with local interface  350  and provides a communication coupling between capture card  20  and processing element  330 . Adapter interface  360  is implemented as a socket, or expansion slot, and associated circuitry disposed on a backplane, e.g., a motherboard, of system  300 . Capture card  20 , e.g., a daughter card, is coupled with adapter interface  360  and, in turn, may be coupled with a multimedia source, e.g., analog device  10 .  \\n      Embodiments of the present invention provides that analog video and audio signals supplied to capture card  20  are converted to corresponding digital video and audio signals. The digital video and audio signals are conveyed to processing element  330  and processed according to the instruction set of analysis application  60 . Multi-channel audio is generated from a single channel monophonic audio signal. The multi-channel audio signal is passed to mastering software  30  application for writing to an optic disc by writeable optic disc device  40 .  \\n      Analysis application  60  is preferably implemented as an instruction set(s), or program, of computer-readable logic. The instruction set is preferably maintained on any one of various conventional computer-readable mediums. In the context of this document, a \\u201ccomputer-readable medium\\u201d can be any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer-readable medium can be, for example, but is not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semi-conductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium now known or later developed.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005202704-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A lampholder having an inner part and an outer part is formed relative to an axis with a radially extending and axially open slot in turn having an inner portion in the inner part and an outer portion in the outer part.

More particularly this invention concerns a holder for a bipin tube-type lamp, normally fluorescent.  \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n      A tube-shaped lamp, normally fluorescent, is known having at each end a pair of connector pins that extend axially at a standardized spacing. These pins allow the lamp to be powered when it is on and allow it to be ignited at the start of use, typically by applying a short-duration high-voltage burst between two of the pins.  \\n      The standard medium bipin base has been replaced with several other formats that correspond to lamps operating at different starting and operating voltages. Thus, although the pin spacing and length is normally the same, the pins are differently shaped so that, in theory, a lamp cannot be fitted to a fixture that is not adapted to run it. Thus while a medium bipin base has two cylindrical pins of uniform cross-sectional size, a G5 base has two pins of flattened or oval section that may be formed with grooves. Fitting a fixture with a lamp that is supposed to be started with or operate at a different voltage can lead to damage not only to the lamp, but to the fixture.  \\n      Thus it is the responsibility of the manufacturer of the lampholders to produce them in the different sizes required by the different lamps. This poses a manufacturing and inventory problem as, not only must the different holders be produced according to different specifications, but they must stocked, marketed, and cataloged individually. The obvious result is to increase the cost of the lampholders, produced in huge quantities by mass production, thereby raising the costs of the fixtures they are incorporated into.  \\n     OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION  \\n      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved holder for bipin tube-type fluorescent lamp.  \\n      Another object is the provision of such an improved holder for bipin tube-type fluorescent lamp that overcomes the above-given disadvantages, in particular that allows holders for different lamps to be produced at low cost.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      A lampholder having an inner part and an outer part is formed relative to an axis with a radially extending and axially open slot in turn having an inner portion in the inner part and an outer portion in the outer part. The portions are alignable with each other and both have a predetermined large width. According to the invention an adapter has a body shaped to fit with one of the lampholder parts and having a formation engaged in the respective slot portion to define therein an adapter slot aligned with the respective slot portion and of a small width substantially less than the predetermined large width so that a lamp pin of a width greater than the small width but smaller than the large width cannot slide through the one slot portion. The adapter body is fixed to the one part of the lampholder.  \\n      It is therefore possible to use a standard wide-slot lampholder with the newer narrow-pin lamps. Instead of having to rebuild the entire lampholder, it is merely equipped with an adapter that makes it impossible to fit a fat-pin lamp into the holder. The adapter can be produced at minor cost and can be added to the lampholder on installation of the holder in a fixture by the assembler. Thus it is not necessary to manufacture and stock a wide variety of lampholders; instead a basic lampholder can be equipped with different adapters for use with different lamps, at much less cost.  \\n      The inner part of the lampholder is normally a rotor received in the outer part and rotatable about the axis in the outer part. In one embodiment the one part is the outer part and the adapter is U-shaped and fitted over the outer part. Thus the adapter can be an inexpensive injection-molded plastic element. According to the invention the adapter can be of a different color than the lampholder, to accurately show what style of lamp the holder has been adapted for.  \\n      The outer part is formed adjacent the slot with an outwardly open hole that can in fact be the normally formed test holes for the lampholder. In this case the adapter body has two arms fitted into the holes. The arms are each formed with a barb engaged with the lampholder. Thus it is possible to simply snap the adapter on the lampholder, although it is also within the scope of the invention to secure it with adhesive or a weld.  \\n      To best center the adapter, its body is formed with a pair of lips defining the adapter slot and projecting into the outer slot portion. In addition the outer part has a generally cylindrical outer surface, and the adapter body has a generally cylindrical inner surface fitted to the outer-part outer surface. Furthermore the adapter body has a generally cylindrical outer surface generally parallel to its inner surface.  \\n      In another arrangement according to the invention the one part is the inner part and the adapter body is an insert in the inner part. Thus the rotor of the lampholder is equipped with the adapter to restrict the width of the inner part of the pin-receiving slot extending diametrally across the holder. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING  \\n      The above and other objects, features, and advantages will become more readily apparent from the following description, reference being made to the accompanying drawing in which:  \\n       FIG. 1  is a perspective view of a prior-art lampholder with a standard bipin-base lamp;  \\n       FIG. 2  is a perspective view of the lampholder equipped according to the invention with an adapter for holding a lamp with a different bipin base;  \\n       FIG. 3  is a view like  FIG. 2  but taken in the opposite direction;  \\n       FIGS. 4 and 5  are side and end views of the structure of  FIG. 3 ;  \\n       FIGS. 6 and 7  are end and perspective exploded end views of the holder and adapter according to the invention;  \\n       FIG. 8  is a large-scale cross section through the lampholder and adapter in accordance with the invention;  \\n       FIG. 9  is a perspective view of the inventive lampholder and adapter with a lamp having a different bipin base; and  \\n       FIGS. 10 and 11  are side and end views of the structure of the structure of  FIG. 9 .  \\n    \\n    \\n     SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION  \\n      As seen in  FIG. 1 a  standard lampholder  10  is made to hold a lamp  13  having a base  12  with a pair of standard parallel cylindrical pins  11 . The holder  10  has a body  16  holding a rotor  17 . The body  16  is formed with a slot  14  of a relatively great width W ( FIG. 5 ) and the rotor  17  with a slot  15  of the same width W. The pins  11  of the lamp  13  are of a diameter that is slightly less than the width W. This structure corresponds to that described in EP 0,735,630. In use the lamp  13  is pushed perpendicularly to a center axis A of the rotor  17  so that the pins  11  pass down through the outer slot  14  and into the slot  15  of the rotor  17 . Then the lamp  13  and rotor  17  are rotated about the axis A to lock the bulb  13  in place and make the desired electrical connections to the pins  11 .  \\n      According to the invention the holder  10  is equipped with an adapter  18  shown in  FIGS. 2 through 8  and forming a slot  19  of a width w that is substantially less than the width W. As best shown in  FIGS. 4 through 8 , the adapter  18  has a one-piece body formed of injection-molded plastic. It has a part-cylindrical inner surface that fits with a part-cylindrical outer surface of the holder  10 , and has a part-cylindrical outer surface parallel to its inner surface so that it is of uniform thickness. The adapter  18  is of a color that is normally different from that of the holder  10  and that is keyed to the width w of its slot  19 , thereby indicating the format of the lamp it is to be used with.  \\n      The holder  10  is formed to each side of the outer slot  14  with a pair of outwardly open holes  22  that are normally used as the so-called Top Test holes through which electrical probes can be inserted to check the fitting. The concave inner face of the adapter  18  is formed with a pair of arms  20  that project into these holes  22  and that have barbed inner ends  21  that catch on sides  23  of the holes  22 , thereby solidly locking the adapter  18  to the holder  10 , so solidly that it is normally necessary to break the adapter  18  to remove it.  \\n      In addition to ensure that the adapter  18  fits solidly on the holder  10 , it has lips  24  flanking and defining its slot  19  and fitting into the outer slot  14  of the holder  10 . Thus as shown in  FIG. 2 , it is impossible for a standard-pin lamp  13  to be fitted in the lampholder  10  once it is equipped with the adapter  18 . As shown in  FIGS. 3, 4 , and  5 , however, a lamp  13 \\u2032 having a base  12 \\u2032 with narrow oval-section pins  1 \\u2032, e.g. of the G5 type, can be fitted through the slot  19  into the holder  10 .  \\n       FIGS. 9 through 11  shown another arrangement where an adapter is formed as an insert  26  that is fitted to or part of a rotor  17 \\u2032 of the holder  10  and that has a slot  25  of the narrow width w. This adapter/insert  26  or rotor  17 \\u2032 can be used instead of or even in addition to the adapter  18  of  FIGS. 2 through 9 . The rotor  17 \\u2032 and/or its insert  26  can be differently colored from the rest of the holder  10  as described above to indicate that the holder  10  has been adapted for use with a particular type or lamp.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004110501-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"When a user is confirmed to be a subscriber of a mobile communication network, to which a manager of hot spots is tied up with its dealer, at the time of accessing of an access point in the location of one of these hot spots by the user, the user can utilize communication services as one who has met the confirmation at these hot spots.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"What is claimed is:  \\n     \\n         1 .

From the standpoint of the subject matter of the invention, however, this is by no means limitative. Thus, in this specification, this term is used such that it covers all electric communication dealers.  \\n     [0019] In the above example, the confirmation in the location of each of the hot spots  21  to  24  that the user  10  is a subscriber of a mobile communication network managed by the PHS carrier  30  as communication dealer  10  is executed when the user  10  accesses the pertinent access point of that hot spot.  \\n     [0020] When it is confirmed that the user  10  is a subscriber of the mobile communication network managed by the above communication dealer (i.e., PHS carrier  30 ), regarding the plurality of hot spots  21  to  24  which provide communication services utilizing the mobile communication network managed by the above communication dealer, the pertinent user  10  is approved as one having met necessary authentication to utilize communication services in these hot spots.  \\n     [0021] By this authentication, the user  10  is released from the cumbersomeness that he or she has to carry out the procedure of independent authentication for each of the hot spots  21  to  24 , and when he or she arrives at any of the hot spots  21  to  24  by his or her own movement, at that point he or she can immediately utilize communication services in the pertinent hot spot.  \\n     [0022] On the other hand, the manager of the hot spots  21  to  24  pays the communication fee corresponding to the extent of use of communication services by the users in the location of each hot spot in response to a demand by the communication dealer (i.e., the PHS carrier  30  in this embodiment), and the communication dealer demands the communication expenditures to each user.  \\n     [0023] As an alternative method dealing with the communication fees or the like, the communication dealer (i.e., PHS carrier  30 ) may manage the system by prepaid or rental provision of a means for limiting such quantity as the number of times or time interval of approval of the communication by the wireless LAN card or the like to pertinent mobile communication network subscribers, for instance particularly desiring particular subscribers, or in some cases all the subscribers. By this method, such labor as demanding individual fees or making corresponding payments can be reduced.  \\n     [0024] While the above description has been made in connection with a case, in which the communication dealer is a PHS carrier, that is, the mobile station of the mobile communication network is PHS, the concept underlying the present invention is not limited to this case; for example, the invention is of course applicable to the case of communication network based on the ordinary portable telephone system.  \\n     [0025] As has been described in the foregoing, according to the invention the user is released from the cumbersomeness that it is necessary to carry out the procedure of authentication afresh for every one of hot spots, which are managed by a manager tied up with a mobile communication network dealer, to which the user itself has been subscribed, and thus the convenience can be improved.  \\n     [0026] Changes in construction will occur to those skilled in the art and various apparently different modifications and embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The matter set forth in the foregoing description and accompanying drawings is offered by way of illustration only. It is therefore intended that the foregoing description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004139370-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A method includes determining that a source code statement violates an accessibility rule, and reporting a source code error corresponding to the determined violation of the accessibility rule.

Each of the various user devices (e.g., computers) described herein include an operating system. The operating system is software that controls the computer system&#39;s operation and/or the allocation of resources. The term \\u201cprocess\\u201d or \\u201cprogram\\u201d refers to software, for example, an application program that may be executed on a computer system. The application program refers to the set of executable instructions, based on source code statements, that perform a task(s) desired by the user, using computer resources made available through the operating system.  \\n       [0003] A source code file includes source code statements written in a programming language, such as Visual Basic (VB), JAVA, C++, etc. Typically, a compiler program is used to convert the source code file into an executable program that includes machine language instructions executable by a computer processor. A computer system may be used to execute a compiled executable program. The executable program may allow information to be passed between a user and the computer system. For example, information may be passed between the user and computer system using conventional means such as a display device (e.g., a monitor, a screen) a keyboard, a mouse, a speaker, and/or a physical transducer (e.g., a microphone), etc. However, this is not meant to preclude the use of other mechanisms for passage of information between a user and a computer system.  \\n       [0004] Certain terms used throughout this specification and claims, although originating in the context of conventional visual displays, are intended to include corresponding functions in the context of other types of information delivery. For example, \\u201cWindow\\u201d refers to any set of information available for presentation to a user through a graphical user interface (GUI). A \\u201cwindow\\u201d may include information displayed in a portion of a visual computer display, or may encompass the entire visual computer display. A GUI may cause the display of a \\u201cdesktop\\u201d, which refers to a graphical work surface analogous to a surface of a desk. Windows may overlay the desktop, and the desktop display may include an icon(s) representing programs, files and/or resources available to the user. As such, the desktop acts as a launching point for running application programs, opening documents or files, displaying menus, and initiating operating system services.  \\n       [0005] A typical display window includes one or more \\u201cactive\\u201d regions. The active regions are associated with instructions to be executed upon the occurrence of an event within an active region. For example, instructions associated with an active region may cause a jump to a specified location upon the occurrence of a mouse-click within the active region. Other events can also cause the execution of instructions. In particular, a detected movement of a mouse and/or an entry of a mouse pointer into an active region (in either case, with or without a click of a mouse button) are also events that may be used to trigger the execution of instructions associated with that region. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0006]FIG. 1 is a block diagram of computer hardware on which a process of source code analysis may be implemented.  \\n     [0007]FIG. 2 is a flowchart of a first embodiment of a source code analysis process.  \\n     [0008]FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a source code error report and display process.  \\n     [0009]FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a second embodiment of a source code analysis process.  \\n     [0010]FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a process for analyzing objects for accessibility. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION  \\n     [0011]FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary computer system  10  that may be used to perform a source code analysis process. In this example, computer system  10  includes a processor  12 , a memory (e.g., a random access memory)  14 , a storage medium  16  (e.g., a hard drive, a floppy drive, etc.), a data communications device  18  (e.g., a modem, a network interface, etc.), a monitor  20  (e.g., CRT, LCD display, etc.), a mouse pointing device  22  and a keyboard  24 . Computer system  10  usually operates under the control of an operating system  30 . Storage medium  16  may be used to store data and/or machine-executable instructions that are executed by processor  12  from memory  14  to perform user device functions.  \\n     [0012] An analyzer process  50  (e.g., a program) may be executed from memory  14  to perform an analysis of a source code file  60  to determine whether any source code statements included in source code file  60  may cause a reduction in accessibility to information for a user of a program based on source code file  60 . Analyzer process  50  may be used to determine whether a software program violates an accessibility rule(s)  70  related to the output of information to a display device, and/or the input of information from an input device associated with the display device. Accessibility rules  70  may relate to source code statements that affect visual outputs (e.g., source code that may affect the display/output of images or text), audible outputs (e.g., source code that may affect sound outputs), speech inputs/recognition (e.g., code that may affect the input of commands and/or data associated with a spoken word), and inputs from a user-controlled device (e.g., code that may affect the ways that input areas on a display screen are displayed and the types of actions a user must undertake to select and enter information into the input area).  \\n     [0013]FIG. 2 depicts a flowchart of analyzer process  50  that may be performed to analyze source code file  60  for violations of accessibility rules  70 . As will be explained in greater detail, accessibility rules  70  refer to a rule(s) that defines a source code statement(s) (or a combination of source code statements) that may reduce accessibility to information by a user(s) having a disability when executing a program corresponding to source code file  60 . Process  50  includes inputting ( 75 ) a source code file name (or directory name), determining ( 80 ) whether the source code file includes a command line statement that violates an accessibility rule  70  (a \\u201csource code error\\u201d), and, through sub-process  85 , storing and/or reporting ( 85 ) any determined violations to a user of process  50 . Process  50  include determining ( 90 ) if additional command lines are available to test for accessibility rule violations, and optionally includes determining ( 95 ) whether additional files referenced by source code file  60  or related to the directory name are available for analysis by process  50 .  \\n     [0014] Process  50  performs an analysis of a source code file, and, therefore, does not require execution of an executable file corresponding to the source code file to determine an accessibility rule violation. Moreover, performance of process  50  does not require a user to interact with the analysis tool in \\u201creal-time\\u201d, rather the user may cause the execution of process  50  and review the results of the analysis at a later time.  \\n     [0015]FIG. 3 depicts a flowchart of sub-process  85  that may be performed to store, report and/or display a source code error, a source code statement(s), and/or a suggested correction to a source code line. Sub-process  85  includes storing ( 90 ) the determined source code error for display, report or forwarding to a user, determining ( 95 ) whether a display of an error report (e.g., a display of a rule violation summary corresponding to the source code accessibility error) has been selected, and displaying ( 100 ) the error report on a user device. Sub-process  85  includes determining ( 105 ) whether the user has selected a display of the source code statement corresponding to the source code accessibility error and/or a display of a suggested correction to that source code statement, and displaying ( 107 ) a report based on the user selection. Sub-process  85  includes determining ( 110 ) whether a correction/edit has been made to the displayed source code statement, and inputting that correction/edit to the source code statement (e.g., to source code file  60 ), and determining whether additional source code statements corresponding to source code accessibility error are available for display. Sub-process  85  optionally includes performing ( 130 ) process  50  to analyze the corrected/edited source code statement and/or source code file  60 .  \\n     [0016] Sub-process  85  allows a user to easily display reports of source code accessibility error(s), and/or source code statements and/or suggested corrections corresponding to source code accessibility error(s). In this way, a user can ensure that an application based upon source code file  60  will be in compliance with accessibility rules  70 . Moreover, through repetitive use of process  50 , and/or sub-process  85 , a user may learn to identify types source code statement(s) (or combinations of source code statements) that may cause accessibility rule violations, the learning may reduce the time required to produce accessibility rule compliant code in subsequent programming produced by the user.  \\n     [0017] Accessibility rules  70  are usable to ensure that a program corresponding to a source code file allows a user having a disability access to information that is comparable to the access and use by a user without a comparable disability (e.g., accessibility rules are usable to determine source code instructions that may reduce access to information for a user having a disability.) Accessibility rules  70  refer to a rule(s) that define a source code statement(s) (or a combination of source code statements) that may reduce accessibility to information by a user(s) having a disability when executing a program corresponding to source code file  60 .  \\n     [0018] In an embodiment, accessibility rules  70  may be based on suggested accessibility standards related to \\u00a7508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 United States Code \\u00a7794d). \\u00a7508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, is hereby incorporated by reference. \\u00a7508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, users with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use or a user who do not have a comparable disability. \\u00a7508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities. The purpose of the suggested accessibility standards related to \\u00a7508 is to build as much accessibility as is reasonably possible into general products developed, procured, maintained, or used by Federal agencies.  \\n     [0019] The following examples describe accessibility standards that may be the basis for related accessibility rule(s)  70 .  \\n     [0020] As a first example, menu functions in a drawing program may allow a user to open, save, size, rotate, and/or perform an action(s) on a graphic image by interacting with a mouse (e.g., a pointing device). A user with a disability that affects dexterity may find it difficult or impossible to move the mouse with sufficient accuracy to activate features presented by the drawing program. Another user who is able to move the mouse adequately may be unable to see the computer display screen to determine what is being pointed to when the mouse is moved. Therefore, a related accessibility rule may include determining whether a keyboard shortcut is included in a program to a function identified with a text label.  \\n     [0021] As a second example, a graphical toolbar may include a visual shortcut to a function that may also exist in a menu structure of a program. In more detail, a scroll function may have a keyboard alternative, such as the use of the \\u201cPage Up\\u201d, and/or \\u201cPage Down\\u201d keys to access the scroll function. If the function activated by the control on a toolbar is a duplicate of a menu function that already has a keyboard shortcut then the toolbar control does not need its own keyboard access. Therefore, an accessibility rule may include determining if a function depicted on a graphical toolbar is unique and requiring that the function have an associated keyboard shortcut.  \\n     [0022] As a third example, some applications and/or operating systems have identified accessibility features. Typically, these identified accessibility features may be turned on or off by a user, for example, identified accessibility features may include reversing a color scheme (to assist people with low vision), showing a visual prompt when an error tone is sounded (to assist persons who are deaf or hard of hearing), and/or providing a \\u201csticky key\\u201d that allows a user to press a key combination (such as \\u201cControl-C\\u201d) sequentially rather than simultaneously (to assist persons with dexterity disabilities). Therefore, an accessibility rule may include a rule prohibiting an application from disabling an identified accessibility feature when activated prior to executing the application.  \\n     [0023] As a fourth example, an accessibility rule may require an application not use flashing and/or blinking text, objects, or elements (e.g., flashing and/or blinking within a specific frequency range.) This accessibility rule is in consideration of those users who may have photosensitive conditions (e.g., photosensitive epilepsy).  \\n     [0024] As a fifth example, an application may use electronic forms. A related accessibility rule may require that keyboard alternatives be provided for navigating through the electronic form, and/or elements of the electronic form are labeled with associated text located relatively close to each field that is to be completed. For example, if a checkbox is displayed, an associated text label must be available to indicate what is being checked, and the current status of the checkbox (e.g., checked or unchecked).  \\n     [0025] As a sixth example, an application may allow a user to select a system setting that affects an output of a computer (e.g, a display color, and/or contrast level) or an input to the computer (e.g., a keyboard repeat rate, and/or keyboard sensitivity). If another application disables these system settings, accessibility may be affected. Therefore, a related accessibility rule may require an application to use a user-selected system setting(s) and not over-ride those setting(s) during execution of the application.  \\n     [0026] Accessibility rules  70  may also refer to a rule(s) that determines whether a source code statement(s) may interfere with the operation of a so-called \\u201cassistive technology\\u201d feature included in an application. Assistive technology refers to features included in an application for a user with a disability to provide program accessibility. For example, assistive technology may refer to an included feature to cause a Braille display, or an included feature that causes an audible output(s) based on computer screen display information.  \\n     [0027] The following examples describe accessibility rule(s) that may be included in accessibility rules  70  and based on assistive technology requirements.  \\n     [0028] As a first example, a position on a display screen where an action may occur may be referred to as the \\u201cfocus\\u201d. For example, when a menu item displayed by a program is highlighted, if a user clicks a mouse or presses a key, a function related to the item displayed will activate and that item has the \\u201cfocus\\u201d. In this case, providing a visual indication of the focus allows a user who is viewing the screen to more accurately access the programs&#39; features. A related accessibility rule may require that the position of a programs&#39; focus be made available to assistive technology, e.g., a defined indication of the current focus shall be provided that moves among elements as the input focus changes.  \\n     [0029] As a second example, text may be associated with a user interface element, e.g., text may be associated with a button, a menu, a toolbar, a scroll bar, etc. The associated text may an action that may be performed by selection of the element. A related accessibility rule may include requiring a program that causes a display of an element with associated text also output information to identify the element, its state, so that an assistive technology may process the associated text information  \\n     [0030] As a third example, when programs are written using unique schemes for displaying text on a display screen and/or use graphics, assistive technology may not be able to interpret the unique schemes. Therefore, a related accessibility rule may require that when a unique scheme of displaying text is used, the text should also be made available to the operating system (e.g., the text is also written to the written to the screen through an operating system API).  \\n     [0031] As a fourth example, when elements such as buttons and/or text are animated, an assistive technology application may not be able to access information related to animation.

Process  200  is presented as a three-layer process including a first layer  210 , a second layer  220  and a third layer  230 . First layer  210  represents a presentation layer that includes sub-processes  212 - 214  to present information to a user of process  200 , receive commands and data from the user and report/display information related to determined source errors. Second layer  220  represents an analysis layer to analyze source code statements and determine any source code error(s) included in an internal data file  233  (e.g., a source code file). Third layer  230  represents a data storage/retrieval layer to store and/or retrieve task information, accessibility rules, internal data file(s) interim results and source code error information as part of a report log on a data storage device  231 . In this example of process  200 , second layer  220  includes objects  222 - 226 . Objects  222 - 226  may represent object-oriented programs that typically include a description of a set of data from database  231 , as well as object references and attributes. Each object may also include \\u201cmethods\\u201d (e.g., instructions or logical sequences) to manipulate the data included in the object. Objects  222 - 226  are used to perform functions when commands and/or data are received from a sub-process  212 - 214 . For example, object task  222  receives and stores information in data task file  232  related to an analysis of a source code file, object parser  223  and object scan  224  perform a parsing and/or a scan of data internal file  233  to determine accessibility rule violations in source code statement(s), object log  225  stores source code error information in data log file  234  and object report stores and retrieves information related to determined source code errors, the information being displayable on a computer display.  \\n     [0112]FIG. 5 depicts a process  300  that may be performed to analyze objects for accessibility rule violations (\\u201crule violations\\u201d). Process  300  includes pre-compiling ( 310 ) a source code file to identify object(s) that may cause rule violations when executed. The identified objects may then be compared to objects that have been classified, for example, objects classified as causing rule violations all of the time (\\u201cType 3\\u201d), some of the time (\\u201cType 2\\u201d), or never (\\u201cType 1\\u201d). The object classification data may be stored on a database accessible to a computer performing process  300 . Process  300  includes determining ( 320 ) whether the current identified object is a known object (e.g., included in the classification database), and reporting ( 322 ) the current object as an \\u201cunknown object\\u201d to the user if the object is not determined as a known object. If the current object is determined to be a known object, process  300  includes determining ( 330 ) if the current object is a Type 1 object (e.g., never causing rule violations), and if the current object is determined to be a Type 1 object, determining ( 390 ) if additional objects are available for scanning. If the current object is determined ( 330 ) not to be a Type 1 object, process  300  includes determining ( 340 ) if the current object is a Type 3 object (e.g., an object classified as always causing a rule violation), and storing ( 85 ) or reporting the current object if it is determined to be a Type 3 object. If the current object is determined not to be a Type 3 object, process  300  includes determining ( 350 ) if the current object contains commands that violate an accessibility rule, and storing ( 85 ) or reporting any command lines determined to violate an accessibility rule. Process  300  includes determining ( 360 ) if additional command lines in the current object for testing for accessibility rule violations, and if there are not additional command lines for testing, determining ( 390 ) if additional objects are identified for scanning (e.g., performing process  300  again to determine additional object(s) that may cause accessibility violations).  \\n     [0113] User devices and/or host computer are not limited to use with the hardware and software of FIG. 1. It may find applicability in any computing or processing environment. They may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of the two. They may be implemented in computer programs executing on programmable computers or other machines that each include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage components), at least one input device, and one or more output devices. Program code may be applied to data entered using an input device (e.g., a mouse or keyboard) to perform applications and to generate output information.  \\n     [0114] Each computer program may be stored on a storage medium/article (e.g., CD-ROM, hard disk, or magnetic diskette) that is readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer for configuring and operating the computer when the storage medium or device is read by the computer to perform applications. They may also be implemented as a machine-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where, upon execution, instructions in the computer program cause a machine to operate in accordance with those applications.  \\n     [0115] The invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described above. For example, source code program  60  and accessibility rules file  70  are generally stored in a file on a data storage device, such as data storage device  16 , or may be read from a data communications device, such as data communications device  18 , or may be entered interactively by a user from an input device, such as keyboard  24 .  \\n     [0116] Other embodiments not described herein are also within the scope of the following claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004142556-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A method of forming electrically conductive elements on a base layer of an electronic substrate without the use of solder mask.

More particularly, this invention relates to fabrication of electronic organic substrates on which monolithic integrated circuits are mounted.  \\n       BACKGROUND  \\n       [0002] Electronic organic substrates, also called printed circuit boards or package substrates, are used as a platform for monolithic integrated circuits, such as array products like ball grid arrays, to which the monolithic integrated circuit is mounted and encapsulated.  \\n       [0003] The package substrate is typically formed of several electrically conductive layers, sandwiched between non electrically conductive layers and a non electrically conductive core. The electrically conductive layers, typically formed of a metal such as copper, are used for power and signal routing. The non electrically conductive core provides structural strength to the substrate, and reduces damage to the package from stresses such as those induced by mechanical load and thermal energy.  \\n       [0004] Typically, a copper layer is deposited on the core material and then a layer of photo imageable ink is applied to the copper layer. A pattern is exposed on the photo imageable, to expose portions of the copper layer, which are then etched away. A layer of solder mask material is then applied over portions of the patterned copper layer, and additional electrically conductive materials, such as nickel and gold, are plated on the exposed portions of the patterned copper layer. A final layer of solder mask may then additionally be applied.  \\n       [0005] Unfortunately, there are several problems with the present methods. For example, there is no current method for directly controlling the width of the materials that are plated on the copper layer, as they can grow out sideways from the copper layer across the substrate. Thus, the features formed in this manner can only be so close together, or they may grow together and form electrically conductive bridges during the plating process. In addition, the non electrically conductive solder mask is typically applied in a screen printing operation. Because geometries can only be reduced to a certain level with screen printing, designers are not able to define electrically conductive traces that are as fine or as close together as may be desired.  \\n       [0006] What is needed, therefore, is a method of fabricating electronic organic substrates that overcomes at least some of these and other problems.  \\n       SUMMARY  \\n       [0007] The above and other needs are met by a method of forming electrically conductive elements on a base layer of an electronic substrate without the use of solder mask. A layer of electrically conductive material is deposited on the base layer, and a first layer of photo imageable ink is applied over the electrically conductive material layer. The first layer of photo imageable ink is patterned to expose portions of the electrically conductive material layer, which are then etched to resolve traces in the electrically conductive material layer. The first layer of photo imageable ink is removed, and a second layer of photo imageable ink is applied over the traces and channels between the traces. The second layer of photo imageable ink is then patterned to expose the traces, and a third layer of photo imageable ink is applied over the traces and the second layer of photo imageable ink. The third layer of photo imageable ink is patterned to expose deposition sites on the traces, within which are formed electrically conductive fingers. Both the second layer and the third layer of photo imageable ink are retained on the electronic substrate.  \\n       [0008] In this manner, the second layer of photo imageable ink is used to constrain the lateral growth of the electrically conductive fingers within the deposition sites, and the traces can be formed at a finer pitch. In addition, because the photo imageable ink can be patterned at a finer resolution than the solder mask can be screen printed, the traces can be formed at an even finer pitch. Thus, the improvements of the present invention enable the fabrication of an electronic substrate having conductive elements that are placed at a finer pitch.  \\n       [0009] In various preferred embodiments there is an additional step of leveling the second layer of photo imageable ink with the traces prior to applying the third layer of photo imageable ink. Preferably the base layer comprises at least one of bismaleimide triazine, flex circuit, and FR4. The electrically conductive material preferably comprises copper, and is most preferably formed to a thickness of between about six mils and about eighteen mils. However, thicker copper tends to be better, and even greater thicknesses may be used. The step of forming electrically conductive fingers preferably comprises first plating a layer of nickel and then plating a layer of gold within the deposition sites. The bottom layer preferably has a thickness of between about five microns and about fifteen microns, and the top layer preferably has a thickness of between about one half micron and about one and one half micron. Preferably, the first layer of photo imageable ink, the second layer of photo imageable ink, and the third layer of photo imageable ink are all formed of a photo imageable ink, such as is commonly available. In one embodiment the base layer is singulated into several concurrently fabricated electronic substrates. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0010] Further advantages of the invention are apparent by reference to the detailed description when considered in conjunction with the figures, which are not to scale so as to more clearly show the details, wherein like reference numbers indicate like elements throughout the several views, and wherein:  \\n     [0011]FIG. 1 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of a base layer of an electronic substrate,  \\n     [0012]FIG. 2 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of a base layer of an electronic substrate that is overlaid with an electrically conductive layer,  \\n     [0013]FIG. 3 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where the conductive layer has been overlaid with a first photo imageable ink,  \\n     [0014]FIG. 4 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where a first photo imageable ink has been patterned,  \\n     [0015]FIG. 5 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where an electrically conductive layer has been etched,  \\n     [0016]FIG. 6 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where the first photo imageable ink has been removed,  \\n     [0017]FIG. 7 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where a second photo imageable ink has been patterned between conductive traces,  \\n     [0018]FIG. 8 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where the second photo imageable ink has been leveled,  \\n     [0019]FIG. 9 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where a third layer of photo imageable ink has been deposited,  \\n     [0020]FIG. 10 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where the third layer of photo imageable ink has been patterned,  \\n     [0021]FIG. 11 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where additional conductive layers have been formed over an exposed portion of the electrically conductive layer, and  \\n     [0022]FIG. 12 is a cross sectional depiction of a portion of an electronic substrate, where the electronic substrate has been singulated into more than one electronic substrate. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION  \\n     [0023] With reference now to FIG. 1, there is depicted a portion of an electronic substrate  10 , with a base layer  12 . The base layer  12  is preferably formed of one or more of bismaleimide triazine, flex circuit, and FR4. The electronic substrate  10  is therefore preferably an organic electronic substrate  10 , of the type adapted to receive an integrated circuit, such as a ball grid array flip chip integrated circuit, and other associated circuits. The processing of the electronic substrate  10  commences, in portion relevant to this disclosure, by forming a layer of an electrically conductive material  14  on top of the base layer  12 , as depicted in FIG. 2. The electrically conductive material  14  is most preferably copper which is formed to a thickness of between about six mils and about eighteen mils, and most preferably about twelve mils, such as formed by an electroless plating process, but may be some other electrically conductive material, and deposited by some other process. However, thicker copper tends to be better, and even greater thicknesses than those described herein may be used.  \\n     [0024] As seen in FIG. 3, a first layer  18  of a photo imageable ink is formed over the electrically conductive layer  14 . The photo imageable ink  18  is preferably one such as is commonly available, provided that it is compatible with the materials, processes, and structures as generally described and implied herein. The first layer  18  of photo imageable ink is preferably patterned, as depicted in FIG. 4, such as with a photolithographic process, where the photo imageable ink is exposed to a projected image, developed, and hard baked.  \\n     [0025] Once the desired image has been formed in the first layer  18  of the photo imageable ink, the underlying electrically conductive layer  14  is preferably etched to define traces  16 . The exposed portions of the base layer  12  where the electrically conductive layer  14  has been removed are referred to as channels  20  between the traces  16 . The first layer  18  of photo imageable ink is removed from the traces  16 , as depicted in FIG. 6, leaving the traces  16  disposed between channels  20  on the base layer  12  of the electronic substrate  10 .  \\n     [0026] A second layer  22  of photo imageable ink is preferably formed on the electronic substrate  10 , and patterned so as to only remain within the channels  20  between the traces  16 . The second layer  22  of photo imageable ink is preferably the same material as the first layer  14  of photo imageable ink. The various patterning steps, generally and briefly described above, are not reiterated here, so as to not unduly detract from the more important aspects of the invention. The second layer  22  of photo imageable ink might be thicker than the traces  16 . If so, then the electronic substrate is optionally and preferably leveled so as to reduce the height of the second layer  22  of photo imageable ink  22  to about the same height as the traces  16 , as depicted in FIG. 8.  \\n     [0027] A third layer  24  of photo imageable ink  24  is preferably formed over the electronic substrate  9 , and patterned as depicted in FIG. 10 to expose portions of the traces  16 , which are referred to herein as deposition sites  26 . The deposition sites  26  preferably have a width that is substantially equal to the width of the traces  16 . The deposition sites  26  are preferably those sites through which electrical connections between the electronic substrate  10  and the integrated circuit which is mounted thereon are made. The third layer  24  of photo imageable ink  24  is preferably the same material as the first layer  14  of photo imageable ink and the second layer  22  of photo imageable ink.  \\n     [0028] Most preferably, electrically conductive fingers are formed within the deposition sites  26 , such as by plating one or more electrically conductive materials. In most preferred embodiment, a layer of nickel  28  is first deposited to a thickness of between about five microns and about fifteen microns, and most preferably about ten microns, and then a layer of gold is next deposited to a thickness of between about one half micron and about one and one half micron, and most preferably about one micron, as depicted in FIG. 11. The electronic substrate  10  so formed may then be singulated into multiple electronic substrates  10 , such as represented in FIG. 12. However, it is appreciated that the representations of the electronic substrates  10  as depicted in FIG. 12 are partial representations only, and that in actual embodiment, the electronic substrates  10  so singulated would preferably be substantially identical and much larger and more complex.  \\n     [0029] At least one monolithic integrated circuit is then preferably affixed to the individualized electronic substrate  10 . Most preferably the integrated circuit is encapsulated against the electronic substrate  10 .  \\n     [0030] The second and third layers  22  and  24  of photo imageable ink are preferably retained on the electronic substrate  10 . In this manner, the third layer  24  of photo imageable ink provides electrical masking functions similar to those that are typically provided by a solder mask layer, which is not required in the embodiments of the present invention. Further, the second layer  22  of photo imageable ink substantially prohibits the electrically conductive materials  28  and  30  from forming in the channels  20  between the traces  16 , and possibly shorting between the traces  16 .  \\n     [0031] Thus, the methods of the present invention allow the traces  16  to be placed closer together that could previously be accomplished with a typical solder mask process, because the placement and critical dimensions of the photo imageable ink can be much more precisely controlled.  \\n     [0032] The foregoing description of preferred embodiments for this invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiments are chosen and described in an effort to provide the best illustrations of the principles of the invention and its practical application, and to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as is suited to the particular use contemplated.

Facing the crisis, all Americans particularly seniors and the 41.2 million uninsured endure untold suffering, indignity, physical and psychological pain, overdose on drugs, receive unnecessary or ineffective treatments and procedures, and a lowered living standard. The business of medicine has transformed patients, pills, procedures and premiums into commodities.

The healthcare costs to people, companies and government are escalating while the healthcare quality is deteriorating.  \\n       [0010] The present invention is a method and means for solving American healthcare crisis wherein the consumers, individual, employer, company and government buyers of healthcare products and services contribute and pool their resource means for compensating physicians and healthcare professionals into a healthcare-purchasing cooperative or healthcare-purchasing cooperatives. These financial resources including performance-related incentives are owned, managed and operated by the cooperative(s) which utilizes said financial resources and incentives to optimally benefit aforementioned parties. The healthcare-service productivity and creativity of physicians and healthcare professionals are maximized. Moreover, based on the utilizations of goods and services, dispensations, efficiency and outcomes of services, performance, merits and ranking of the physicians or healthcare professionals relative to their peers, physicians and healthcare professionals are facilitated and encouraged to optimally provide the best healthcare goods and services in return for proportionate and adjustable compensations and incentives. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION  \\n     [0011] The present invention is a method and means for solving a healthcare crisis particularly American healthcare crisis. In fact, the present invention creates and provides the best healthcare system in the world. In the present invention, consumers such as, patients, and individual, employer, company and government buyers of healthcare products and services and the physicians and healthcare professionals form a check-and-balance system of healthcare wherein said parties are responsive to each other healthcare and financial needs. Said parties mutually benefit from each other.  \\n     [0012] In the present invention, consumers and individual, employer, company and government buyers\\u2014American and foreign\\u2014of healthcare goods and services contribute their resources such as money and incentives into a pool or pools of money and incentives which are to be used to pay and compensate for the healthcare goods and services being rendered by physicians and healthcare in America and other countries. Said pool or pools of money and incentives are managed and administered by a healthcare-purchasing cooperative or healthcare purchasing cooperatives in America and other countries wherein said resources can be managed, allocated, renewed, invested, used for paying said goods and services. Said resources are fully owned and managed by said consumers and individual, employer, company and government buyers until such a time when a portion of said resources are paid out as compensations to physicians and healthcare professionals supra. The management and administering of the assets and account payables in said pools are the responsibility of the board of directors or governors and officers responsible to said consumers and individual, employer, company and government buyers and owners and physicians and healthcare professionals. Said cooperatives can be listed in the stock markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and are publicly traded.  \\n     [0013] The present invention further provides the method and means for optimally utilized said financial resources in return for optimal healthcare goods and services being provided and rendered to said consumers and individual, employer, company and government buyers and owners of said financial resources by said physicians and healthcare professionals.  \\n     [0014] In this check-and-balance business-healthcare system, all people including the uninsured and people from other countries have access to the optimal and best healthcare at the most affordable and nominal costs. Moreover, the costs to an individual consumer or buyer are based various financial circumstances and settings such as, but not limited to, incomes, ability to pay, standards of living, number of persons in a household or a company. From the standpoint of the physicians and healthcare professionals, all are participants of said system without discrimination and regardless of affiliations.  \\n     [0015] A computer system comprises computer softwares comprising programs and utilizes the Internet and World Wide Web adaptable to unite and coordinate the efforts and utilization of all financial, human and technological resources of said consumers, individual, employer, company and government buyers and owners, corporation, physicians and healthcare professionals. For example, said programs have the ability to record, track, analyze and correlate the dispensations, utilizations, allocations and administration of said financial resources and healthcare goods and services by said parties; the performance, efficiency, treatment and preventive medicine means, modes and positive and negative outcomes relating to a physician, a healthcare professional, a group of physicians or healthcare professionals or a network of physicians or healthcare professionals; compare and analyze said information and data among said parties, cohorts and peers, etc.  \\n     [0016] In other words, said softwares and programs can provide information and data including, but not limited to, analyses, extrapolations and projections of ways and means said consumers and buyers utilize said financial, human and healthcare resources, the productivity of said physicians and healthcare professionals and their performance, efficiency and proficiency relative to those of their peers in absolute and relative terms. As a result, said managements and allocations and compensations can be optimally effected thereby keeping costs at the lowest while maximizing and optimizing services and productivity of all parties.  \\n     [0017] For example, said computer programs and softwares can sort and rank physicians and healthcare professionals based on the above data. For example, in pain specialty in a given geographic location, say, New York City or Washington, D.C., for example, a group of physicians can be sorted and ranked leading to variable accessibility and visibility on the computer screens being viewed by any and all consumers and buyers in New York City, Washington, D.C. or any other locations throughout the world. In other words, the more proficient and wiser a physician in utilizing said financial resources benefiting said consumers, buyers and cooperatives while providing the most optimal healthcare services to said parties the more patients and compensations said physician gets. Said physician then can propagate his skills and knowledge to others. On the contrary, the lesser proficient and less wise physician under said circumstances and settings will have less patients and receive less compensations.  \\n     [0018] Based on the above sorting, ranking and data, said computer program proportionately compensates every physician or healthcare professional. In other words, for example, said programs have the ability to use said information and data to determine and adjustable variable amounts of compensations based on said factors such as, but not limited to, dispensations, utilizations, allocations and administration, performance, efficiency, merits, treatment and preventive medicine means, modes and positive and negative outcomes of a physician, a healthcare professional, a group of physicians or a group healthcare professionals. Of course, overhead costs per geographic location are incorporated into said data such as the rent and employee wages in New York City versus those in Fairbanks, Ak.  \\n     [0019] A simplified example of utilizations based on said incentive approach is a sample case in diabetes. If a national norm for an established diabetic patient&#39;s visit to an endocrinologist&#39;s office is three visits per month at a cost of $X per month. Various extenuated factors are entered and considered by said computer program and physician peers, the same endocrinologist may be compensated by said cooperative or cooperatives for the same amounts covering only three visits for all total visits greater than three per month for a said given patient. On the contrary, the same endocrinologist will have highest ranking and visibility in the computer search and on the computer screen meaning greater access by patients, respectively, if same is able to consistently and optimally keep average patients&#39; visit less than the national or international norm. However, the disincentive is applied to same if patient(s) of same ends up seeing other endocrinologist(s) or developed diabetic-related complications or emergencies necessitating more healthcare.  \\n     [0020] Another simple example is the arthroscopic surgery for arthritic knee, useless or ineffective devices, or expensive drugs in lieu of cheaper drugs of same indication and efficacy. The utilizations and dispensations of these goods and services resulted in no or lesser compensations by the cooperatives to all parties involved. If consumers so choose to have useless or ineffective, said consumers will need to pay out of pocket.  \\n     [0021] Said ranking, sorting, extrapolations and results are continually and perpetually processed and made available to said parties by said computer programs and softwares and via the Internet or World Wide Web.  \\n     [0022] The present invention eliminates or drastically reduces tons of unnecessary and useless paperwork including correspondence with various third-party payers which physicians and healthcare professionals are subjugated to by the current healthcare system. As a result, the healthcare-service productivity of physicians and healthcare professionals are maximized. Consequently, hundreds of millions of priceless physician and healthcare professional hours saved by the present invention every year can be used to improve the healthcare system, the advancement of healthcare and medicine and serve humanity.  \\n     [0023] Although the preferred embodiments have been described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in business, sciences and medicine that variations, additions and adaptations to the present invention can be had without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004178915-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The invention relates to a flame-monitoring device in which an a.c. input voltage (U1) is limited to a voltage limit (U2) by means of a voltage limiter ( 4 ).

Thus for example DE-OS No 1 815 968 discloses a flame monitoring apparatus in which an ac voltage is supplied to a transformer and subsequently to a peak voltage limiter. The transmission of voltage peaks from the mains to the operating circuit is prevented by the peak voltage limiter. The voltage limiters used for that purpose are for example voltage-dependent resistors (VDR) which provide a limiting effect in a bipolar mode, that is to say in both voltage directions. A problem of such flame monitoring apparatuses however is rectifier effects at the burner, which are not flame-induced, for example in the case of ionization electrodes due to chemical actions between the monitoring electrode and the reference ground. In the limit situation however a flame signal can be simulated by those rectifier effects when a flame is not present. That can result in explosions in the burner installation, and for that reason the attempt is made to avoid the rectifier effects which are not flame-induced, by virtue of sufficient insensitivity in respect of the flame signal amplifiers.  \\n       [0003] The object of the present invention is to make flame monitoring apparatuses of the kind set forth in the opening part of this specification insensitive in relation to non-flame-induced rectifier effects, by suitable measures.  \\n       [0004] In accordance with the invention that object is attained by the features recited in the independent claims.  \\n       [0005] Therefore the core of the invention is that an asymmetric limit voltage which acts on the sensor can be produced by means.  \\n       [0006] By virtue of the production of an asymmetric voltage, the negative effects of non-flame-induced rectifier effects with a high alternating current component, as can occur for example due to the deposit of cleaning agents or test sprays between the ionization electrode and the reference ground and for example mains voltages with an unwanted dc voltage offset can be better suppressed. In that way it is possible to avoid unwanted flame signals when no flame is present.  \\n       [0007] Further advantageous configurations of the invention are set forth in the appendant claims.  \\n       [0008] If semiconductor devices such as Zener diodes are used to produce an asymmetric voltage, it is possible even to cope with device faults in respect of the Zener diode, due to the higher number of Zener diodes in one direction. If a Zener diode fails there are still sufficient diodes for reliable operation of the voltage limiter. The greater the number of additional Zener diodes that are provided to produce the asymmetry, the correspondingly greater faults it is then possible to compensate.  \\n       [0009] The structure with Zener diodes does not exhibit any voltage dependency in comparison with varistors (with small series resistors) and temperature compensation can also be implemented by the use of Zener diodes with different temperature coefficients.  \\n       [0010] If the (unwanted) property of voltage dependency of varistors is to be simulated, that can be done by higher-resistance series resistors in the Zener diode series.  \\n       [0011] The structure with Zener diodes permits ac voltage stabilization with standard components which can be obtained from a number of manufacturers.  \\n       [0012] Implementation of ac voltage limitation by means of diodes, for example in the form of a diode section, also affords the advantage that, for example if it may be necessary that the limited ac voltage of an automatic firing device has to be switched over between two voltage values within a switching sequence, a voltage change-over switching operation can be easily implemented by bridging over some diodes of the diode array. In that case the desired voltage variation can be freely selected by way of the choice of the diodes.  \\n       [0013] In conventional voltage-dependent resistors (VDR) for voltage limitation, the voltage change-over switching procedure would require for example two varistors and a switch or a varistor, a voltage source and a switch.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     [0014] Further advantages will be apparent from the preferred embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention and the method according to the invention, which are described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:  \\n     [0015]FIG. 1 diagrammatically shows a flame monitoring apparatus,  \\n     [0016]FIG. 2A shows an equivalent circuit for an ideal flame,  \\n     [0017]FIG. 2B shows an equivalent circuit for a real flame,  \\n     [0018]FIG. 2C shows an equivalent circuit for a contaminated electrode,  \\n     [0019]FIG. 3 shows an asymmetric ac voltage limiter,  \\n     [0020]FIG. 4A shows the ac voltage at U1,  \\n     [0021]FIG. 4B shows the asymmetric ac voltage at U2,  \\n     [0022]FIG. 4C shows a symmetrical ac voltage U2* from the state of the art,  \\n     [0023]FIG. 5A shows the pattern of the current i with an ideal flame,  \\n     [0024]FIG. 5B shows the pattern of the current i with a contaminated electrode and asymmetric ac voltage, and  \\n     [0025]FIG. 5C shows the pattern of the current i with a contaminated electrode and symmetrical ac voltage. \\n    \\n    \\n     [0026]FIG. 1 diagrammatically shows a flame monitoring apparatus which is fed with an input voltage U1 for example by way of a mains ac voltage  1  and by way of a transformer  2 . The behavior of the input voltage U1 is diagrammatically shown in FIG. 4A. The input voltage U1 is limited to the limit voltage U2 by way of a resistor  3  and a voltage limiter  4 , see FIG. 4B.  \\n     [0027] A flame  6  can be produced by a burner  5 . An ionization electrode  7  projects into the flame region of the flame  6 . The ac voltage U2 is applied to the burner S acting as electrodes, and the ionization electrode  7 . A rectified ionization current occurs due to the flame  6  and the applied ac voltage U2.  \\n     [0028] The ac voltage is filtered out by means of a low pass filter comprising a resistor  8  and a capacitor  9  and only the direct component which is used as a flame signal is passed to an amplifier  10  in which the flame signal is amplified and passed to a regulating device (not shown) for further processing.  \\n     [0029] Instead of the ionization electrode it is also possible to use a UV-sensor or any sensor which acts on the rectification effect of the flame amplifier signal. Under certain conditions those sensors also have undesirable rectification effects, for example with mains voltages with a dc voltage offset or in the case of certain defects in the sensors. Such sensors like also the ionization electrode shown in FIG. 2 can be described by the equivalent circuits of FIGS. 2A and 2B in order to clarify the behavior thereof.  \\n     [0030]FIG. 2A shows the burner, illustrated in FIG. 1 between the points A and B, with the flame and the ionization electrode, in the form of an equivalent circuit for an ideal behavior with a diode  21  and a resistor  20  in series. The diode produces the same rectification effect as the flame.  \\n     [0031]FIG. 2B shows the burner, illustrated in FIG. 1 between the points A and B, with the flame and the ionization electrode, in the form of an equivalent circuit for the real behavior with a diode  21  and a resistor  20  in series, with which a resistor  22  is connected in parallel. By virtue of that arrangement, current flows not only in the forward direction of the diode  21  but also in the reverse direction of the diode.  \\n     [0032]FIG. 2C shows the burner, illustrated in FIG. 1 between the points A and B, with the flame and the ionization electrode, in the form of an equivalent circuit for the real behavior in the case of a contaminated electrode with a diode  21  and a resistor  20  in series, with which a resistor  22  is connected in parallel and a diode  23  and a resistor  24  in series is connected in parallel.  \\n     [0033]FIG. 3 shows a voltage limiter according to the invention for producing an asymmetric voltage, comprising diodes  31  which conduct even in the reverse direction from a certain voltage on, for example so-called Zener diodes, in which respect additional Zener diodes  32  are so arranged in one direction that the voltage in the forward direction of the diode  21  is increased in relation to the voltage in the reverse direction. This means that a high current flows when a flame is present. The direction of installation of the voltage limiter is indicated from the points C and D which correspond to the points C and D in FIG. 1. The number of Zener diodes used is dependent on the respective situation of use and has to be specifically designed for each case. It is advantageous however for the asymmetry to be effected over two diodes in order not to involve a flame simulation even in the event of a possible duplicate defect.  \\n     [0034] For example a diode section for asymmetric voltage limitation to 342V can be implemented by means of 15 identical Zener diodes each of 22V (Uz=(15*22V)+(17*0.7V)=341.9V) and in the other half-wave for voltage limitation to 385V that can be implemented by means of 17 identical Zener diodes each of 22V (Uz=(17*22V)+(15*0.7V)=384.5V). The asymmetry can be limited to only 43V by the choice of 32 Zener diodes. The illustrated series resistors  33  are optional and serve for surge current limitation in the case of transient overvoltages.  \\n     [0035] The diode section should preferably be made up only by way of diodes of the same type and of the same value, that is to say the same breakdown voltage, in order to simplify defect consideration in the event of a possible short-circuit of one (or more) diodes. It is also advantageous only to use diodes from the same manufacturer in order further to reduce irregular defect probability.  \\n     [0036] A current i is measured across the resistor  8  in FIG. 1. If the circuit for the ideal behavior as shown in FIG. 2A is incorporated into the circuit as shown in FIG. 1, that gives the behavior shown in FIG. 5A for i, with a maximum current of i5. That can be explained by the diode  21 , by which the negative half-wave is cut off in the reverse direction.  \\n     [0037] If the circuit for the real behavior as shown in FIG. 2B is incorporated into the circuit shown in FIG. 1, that gives the behavior shown in FIG. 5B, with a maximum current in the positive direction of i1 and in the negative direction of i2. It also follows from the equivalent circuit shown in FIG. 2B however that i1 is greater than i5 (i1&gt;i5) as the resistor  22  is additionally connected in parallel. Now however a current can also flow through that resistor  22  in the negative half-wave, which current has its maximum at i2 but which in magnitude is smaller than i.  \\n     [0038] However the voltage limiter  30  gives rise to an asymmetric behavior in respect of the limit voltage U2, as can be seen from FIG. 4B. FIG. 4C shows a symmetrical voltage U2*, as is known from the state of the art and which is measured at the same measurement points C and D as the voltage U2. If, as already indicated above, the circuit for the real behavior as shown in FIG. 2B is incorporated into the circuit shown in FIG. 1, that, with the symmetrical behavior of the voltage U2* which is known from the state of the art, gives the behavior shown in FIG. 5C with a maximum current in the positive direction of i3 and in the negative direction of i4.  \\n     [0039] What is now crucial for the invention however is the fact that, with approximately equal i2 and i4 (i2=i4), i3 is smaller than i (i3&lt;i1), that is to say the ratio of i1 to i2 is greater than the ratio of i3 to i4 ([i1/i2]&gt;[i3/i4]).  \\n     [0040] That better ratio for an asymmetric voltage now makes it possible to use sensitive flame signal amplifiers, even if non-flame-induced rectification effects have to be suppressed, which permits better evaluation of the actual flame signal.  \\n     [0041] It will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and illustrated.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004189940-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The invention relates to a method and system for determining the topography for reaction signals of an eye.

Eye diseases, for example glaucoma, can be detected early and assessed with the aid of such an examination. Above all, partial defects of the retina can be established with the aid of such examinations.  \\n       [0003] There are a multiplicity of examination methods that operate on a subjective basis, that is to say in which the patient examined evaluates the measurement by his statement. In all these methods, the patient is integrated into the measurement by virtue of the fact that he makes the statement as to whether and how he perceives a specific stimulus.  \\n       [0004] The electroretinogram (ERG) has become established as an objective measuring method; in this case, the reaction signal tapped from the eye with an electrode is displayed and evaluated with its time profile. Single light flashes or cyclic light/dark sequences (flicker ERG) are used for the stimulation. In this case, the mean value is determined for the total retinal area. In the recording of evoked potentials, electrodes are fitted at a specific point on the head, and the measured signal corresponds to the reaction that occurs at the measuring position via nerve cords.  \\n       [0005] Details on this have been published by J. J\\u00f6rg and H. Hielscher in the book entitled \\u201cEvozierte Potentiale in Klinik und Praxis\\u201d [\\u201cEvoked Potentials in Hospitals and General Practice\\u201d]/Springer Verlag.  \\n       [0006] In order to determine the topography of the retinal sensitivity, it is fundamentally possible to stimulate partial surfaces of the retina by individual light stimuli assigned to the respective partial surface, and to measure the reaction. Since it is necessary to form mean values over a multiplicity of measurements in order to reduce the noise, this method results in an unacceptably long measurement time.  \\n       [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,987 proposes the coupling of an ophthalmoscopic system based on a 3-path Maxwell viewing system for optical examination of the retina of the eye to a perimetric system for determining the visual field, it being possible to measure the spectral sensitivity of a selected portion of the retina with the aid of the electroretinogram for which a stimulus pattern is transferred onto the retina. This method can be used to examine the sensitivity of a single portion, and to examine the overall image of the retina. An unacceptably long examination time would also result here for examining all the portions of the retina by measuring them.  \\n       [0008] The use of a laser projector provided with an optical modulator for generating a brightness pattern on the retina for measuring the pattern electroretinogran (PERG) was specified by Daniel R. Peters and John Tabora in U.S. Pat. No. 5,233,373. However, it is also possible thereby to examine only ever a selected surface of the retina, and the examination of a plurality of surfaces can be performed only sequentially.  \\n       [0009] An improved method and the associated system for determining the functional distribution of the reaction over the surface of the retina to stimuli has been specified by R. Richardson in European Patent 0 375 737. Here, the overall reaction of the retina to stimuli in the visual field is recorded, the stimuli being formed by series of patterns whose intensity varies in the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction. As an example, a sinusoidal or cosinusoidal distribution of the intensity is used, and the sensitivity distribution over the surface of the retina can be calculated by inverse transformation from the measured aggregate signals. It is disadvantageous in this method that measuring errors in the determination of the individual coefficients cannot be detected, but that individual measuring errors affect the calculation of the overall distribution function. A further disadvantage in this method is that the resolution must be adapted to the highest density of the sensitivity distribution, although this is present only in a narrowly limited region.  \\n       [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,482 specifies a method in which the stimulus pattern comprises a plurality of quadrilaterals of size increasing outward from the center and whose brightness profile is controlled with different frequencies in the range from 10 Hz to 45 Hz. In the example illustrated, 9 quadrilaterals of simultaneously modulated brightness are used, and the evaluation of the measured signal is performed with the aid of the Fourier transformation. It is true that it is possible in this case to detect the influences of the lower Ganglien cell layers by measuring the Nyquist frequency, but determining the Nyquist frequency requires carrying out a plurality of measurements with a different distribution of the modulation frequencies, and the measuring time must be selected to be so long for each frequency distribution that it is possible to determine unambiguous results for the individual frequencies. It is specified that an extension up to 32 \\u201czones\\u201d is possible. Consequently, even in the case of this extension the method still has a very low resolution with regard to the partial surfaces that can be examined.  \\n       [0011] Another method was specified by E. E. Sutter and D. Tran in the journal Vision Research (Great Britain) Vol. 32, No. 3, pages 433 to 446, 1992, with the aid of which relatively good results were achieved. To determine the topography of the ERG components, a digital method is applied in which use is made as stimuli of hexagons whose temporal brightness profiles are controlled by m-sequences. Use is made in this case of  241  hexagons whose size increases outward from the center. Consequently, account is taken of the unequal density of the distribution function. The overall reaction signal of the eye is measured, and the signal profile is calculated for the relevant hexagon by calculating the cross-correlation function with the respective m-sequence. By weighting the signal profile with the mean value for the corresponding region of partial surfaces, interference is reduced in the determination of the amplitude, included in the signal profile, of the useful signal. To perform the measurement, use is made of m-sequences with a length of 65535 steps, which are always offset from one another by 256 steps. Given a display refresh frequency of 67 Hz, the result is an overall measuring period of approximately 16 minutes, the measurement having been subdivided into 32 time segments each being 30 seconds, plus a time for the overlap. A first disadvantage is that the method can provide exact results only to the extent that the reaction function of the retina also reacts linearly to the stimuli. However, this circumstance obtains only partially in the case of an image refresh rate of 67 Hz, and then only, again, given a short after-glow period of the display screen. A further disadvantage of this method consists in that the signal profile must be monitored subjectively, and the associated time segment must be repeated in the event of detectable interference, for example owing to blinking or given contact problems of the electrode. However, the most important disadvantage is that there is no possible way of assessing the intermediate results of the individual time segments, and that it is only at the end of the measurement, that is to say after the measured values over all time segments are present, that it is possible to determine a result and evaluate this result, and so the total measurement must be repeated when interference is not detected.  \\n       [0012] In U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,567, E. E. Sutter has already specified a basic principle of the method in which a display with a square array of elements that can be activated is used as stimuli, the temporal brightness profiles of the elements being controlled by m-sequences. The calculation of the individual reaction signals is performed with the aid of the cross-correlation function. Here, too, m-sequences of length  2   16 \\u22121=65535 are applied, being offset in each case by  256  steps with reference to one another. It is likewise proposed to subdivide the overall measurement into time segments of approximately 20 to 40 seconds.  \\n       [0013] A development of this method is specified in German Patent 196 49 858, in which short and corrected m-sequences are used for controlling the light/dark sequences. Here, the individual intermediate results can be evaluated, and it is possible both to achieve a higher degree of effectiveness and an enhanced level of reliability in the evaluation of the results.  \\n       [0014] The determination of the topography of the retina of the eye from the reaction signals that result in the case of cyclic stimulation in the steady state is possible both with the method specified by E. E. Sutter and with the method specified in German Patent 196 49 858, but has the disadvantage that a poorer signal-to-noise ratio results for the same time segments, since in the case of the use of m-sequences only every second step of the measuring cycle generates a useful signal, but noise is produced in each step of the m-sequence and, in addition, it is first necessary to produce the steady state in each step of the m-sequence before an evaluation can be performed. Thus, it is therefore possible to evaluate only a portion of the reaction signals of a step, and the result in this portion is formed by two measures of noise and one measure of useful signal.  \\n       [0015] It is the object of the invention to provide a method and a system for determining the topography for reaction signals of an eye with which, in the case of cyclic stimulation in the steady state, the topography of the retina reactions can be determined in the same period with a better signal-to-noise ratio or, given a comparable signal-to-noise ratio, in a substantially shorter period.  \\n       [0016] According to the invention, the object is achieved by virtue of the fact that during the measurement the reaction signal of each partial surface can be used over the entire duration of the measurement in that each partial surface is stimulated by an integral number of oscillations, and that the number of the oscillations for the individual partial surfaces in each case differs by an integral multiple of 1. In this case, a clock pulse rate with a specific total number of clock pulses is generated in a prescribed time segment for the measurement, and from this an integral number of cycles is generated for one oscillation in each case. The generation of the oscillations for the partial surfaces is performed in the following three ways:  \\n       [0017] A mean number of oscillations is formed for a first partial surface by using the cycles generated at the clock pulse rate.  \\n       [0018] For a first group of partial surfaces a first group of oscillations is formed by prolonging the oscillations generated at the clock pulse rate at specific and largely constant intervals by individual clock pulses in each case, as a result of which a smaller number of oscillations occurs in the prescribed total number of clock pulses.  \\n       [0019] For a second group of partial surfaces a second group of oscillations is formed by shortening the oscillations generated at the clock pulse rate at specific and largely constant intervals by individual clock pulses in each case, as a result of which a larger number of oscillations occurs in the prescribed total number of clock pulses.  \\n       [0020] Within each group, use is made for the partial surfaces of a different interval for the prolongation or shortening by one clock pulse, and the number of these clock pulses is in each case an integral multiple of the number of the clock pulses used for the mean oscillation. A plurality of additional oscillations before the time interval for the measurement are provided for reaching the steady state, and at least one additional oscillation after the time interval for the measurement is provided for evaluating the last oscillation. The aggregate signal that is formed from the superimposition of the reaction signals of all the partial surfaces is tapped at the patient and is fed, amplified and filtered, to an analog-to-digital converter that accepts the signal with the same clock pulses used for generating the oscillations. The recovery of the reaction signals for the individual partial surfaces is performed by cyclic summation of the successive portions of the aggregate signal, use being made for the summation of the same cycles as for the oscillations for stimulating the corresponding partial surfaces.  \\n       [0021] The system for carrying out the method according to the invention is achieved by means of the features named in claim  8 . Advantageous refinements are specified in the subclaims.  \\n       [0022] The advantage of the solution according to the invention consists in that it is an objective measuring method, that is to say the measurement is performed independently of whether and how the person perceives which stimulus. A further advantage of the solution according to the invention is the high resolution with regard to the partial surfaces, to be examined, of the retina, which are examined simultaneously, as a result of which there is a short measuring time and it is possible to evaluate intermediate results, a high reliability thereby being achieved for the intermediate results. Moreover, the solution according to the invention has the advantage that during measurement in the steady state (steady-state signals) the steady state is maintained over the entire measuring time and, in particular, that a useful signal is generated from all partial steps of the measuring cycle, the result being a substantially better signal-to-noise ratio. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     [0023] The solution according to the invention is to be explained in more detail with the aid of an exemplary embodiment. In the associated drawing:  \\n     [0024]FIG. 1 shows the design principle of the solution according to the invention,  \\n     [0025]FIG. 2 shows a timing diagram for the generation of the oscillations,  \\n     [0026]FIG. 3 shows a diagram relating to the principle of the cyclic addition,  \\n     [0027]FIG. 4 shows a timing diagram for the cyclic addition,  \\n     [0028]FIG. 5 shows a table with practical values of the oscillations, and  \\n     [0029]FIG. 6 shows an LED surface with an image of 61 hexagons. \\n    \\n    \\n     [0030] The principle of the design of the system used for the measurement is illustrated in FIG. 1. A patient  1  looks at a stimulator  2  that generates a luminous image that is projected onto the retina of the eye. The light/dark control of the partial surfaces of the stimulator  2  is performed via a control unit  3 . The operation of the system, that is to say setting the measurement parameters and the evaluation methods, is performed via a keyboard  5  connected to the control unit  3 . The operator prompting and the evaluation of the results are performed via a display unit  4  connected to the control unit  3 . The reaction signal tapped at the patient  1  is fed via an amplifier  6  to the analog-to-digital converter  7  arranged in the control unit  3 . The amplifier  6  includes a plurality of amplifier stages and a bandpass filter and its parameters can be programmed via the control unit  3 .  \\n     [0031] Oscillations are used to control the individual partial surfaces of the stimulator  2  through light and dark cyclically, a different number of oscillations being used for each partial surface in a prescribed period.  \\n     [0032] The principle is explained by a simple numerical example:  \\n     [0033] starting from a 30 Hz flicker stimulation, N 1 =300 oscillations then result for a period of 10 seconds. This stimulation is used for the first partial surface. In the same period, a second partial surface receives N 2 =299 oscillations, and a third partial surface receives N 3 =301 oscillations. The following frequencies result with these values: f 1 =30 Hz, f 2 =29.9 Hz and f 3 =30.1 Hz. Each partial surface i of the retina generates a reaction signal r that comprises the fundamental wave of the stimulation and corresponding harmonic waves: \\n       r   1   =r   11 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b730 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ r   12 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b760 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ . . .  \\n       r   2   =r   21 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b729.9 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ r   22 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b759.8 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ . . .  \\n       r   31   =r   31 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b730.1 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ r   32 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b760.2 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ . . .  \\n     [0034] The measured signal corresponds to the sum of the individual components. If the reaction signal measured over 10 seconds is now divided into 300 portions and the cyclic sum of these portions is formed, the result is the reaction signal of the first partial surface: \\n       R   1 =300 \\u00b7r   1 =300\\u00b7( r   11 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b730 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ r   21 \\u00b7sin(2\\u03c0\\u00b760 Hz\\u00b7 t )+ . . .  \\n     [0035] The other components generate no signal during the cyclic addition, since their fundamental wave and all harmonic waves are always added with a different phase angle over one or more full oscillations.  \\n     [0036] The reaction signal of the second partial surface is obtained similarly in the case of a division of the signal measured over 10 seconds into 299 portions, and the reaction signal of the third partial surface is obtained similarly in the case of a division into 301 portions. The respective other signal components do not influence the results. The difference consists only in the fact that the individual reaction is calculated once 300-fold, once 299-fold and once 301-fold.  \\n     [0037] However, this deviation may be corrected by a simple conversion using the corresponding coefficients.  \\n     [0038] The deviations from the nominal frequency 30 Hz are +/\\u22120.33% and therefore exert virtually no influence on the result.  \\n     [0039] However, the method can be applied only when fully complete oscillations are used in the time segment considered. This condition is met whenever all the oscillations used are derived from a basic raster.  \\n     [0040]FIG. 2 shows a timing diagram for the generation of the oscillations. In this example, square-wave oscillations are derived from a basic raster with 60 clock pulses. The curve illustrated in the middle has the nominal oscillating frequency of N=10, that is to say each oscillation includes 6 clock pulses. Shortening by single clock pulses at the six marked points produces the curve with 11 oscillations that is shown at the top. If the oscillations are prolonged by one clock pulse in each case at the six marked points, this being done by prolonging the state present at this instant by one clock pulse, the result is N =9 oscillations in the same period. If always complete oscillations are considered, the signal profile can also be described by specifying the length of oscillation if the course from higher level to lower level is always designated as one oscillation.  \\n     [0041] N=11 comprises 6 oscillations relating to 5 clock pulses (3 times 2+3 clock pulses, 3 times 3+2 clock pulses) and 5 oscillations relating to 6 clock pulses.  \\n     [0042] N=10 comprises 10 oscillations relating to 6 clock pulses.  \\n     [0043] N=9 comprises 6 oscillations relating to 7 clock pulses (3 times 4+3 clock pulses, 3 times 3+4 clock pulses) and 3 oscillations relating to 6 clock pulses.  \\n     [0044] Of course, the differences between the in each case two lengths of oscillation can clearly be recognized in the case of so coarse a clock pulse raster. If more clock pulses are used per oscillation together with a larger number of oscillations, the differences also become smaller, and all the oscillations can be considered as virtually continuous.  \\n     [0045] The principle of cyclic addition is illustrated in FIG. 3.  \\n     [0046] Here, an example is selected with N=20 oscillations relating in each case to 5 clock pulses. N=20 symbolizes the signal profile, which was read in as aggregate signal via the path of electrode-amplifier-analog-to-digital converter. It is illustrated symbolically here the a settling region is present upstream of the actual signal portion hatched in, and at least one oscillation is appended at the end, in order still to be able to evaluate the large reaction signal without errors. The cycle lengths with n=5 clock pulses for the cyclic summation is specified below the hatched portion. Only the signal that was stimulated with N=20 is obtained with this summation.  \\n     [0047] Shown symbolically at the top in FIG. 3 with the designation N=21 is the signal profile that is produced by inserting clock pulses at the points that were shortened by one clock pulse during the generation of the oscillations. It is illustrated here in an enlarged fashion how the signal level for the inserted clock pulse is formed as mean value from the preceding and the subsequent signal level. The insertion of the clock pulses results in the longer signal string with N=21 oscillations relating to in each case 5 clock pulses. If the cyclic summation is also carried out here with N=21 cycles relating to n=5 clock pulses, only the signal that was stimulated with N=21 is obtained.  \\n     [0048] Shown symbolically at the bottom in FIG. 3 with the designation N=19 is the signal profile that is produced by removing clock pulses at the points at which the oscillations were prolonged by one clock pulse during the generation. The removal of the clock pulses produces the shorter signal string with N=19 oscillations relating to in each case 5 clock pulses. If the cyclic summation is also carried out here with N=19 cycles relating to n=5 clock pulses, only the signal that was stimulated with N=19 is obtained.  \\n     [0049]FIG. 4 shows a timing diagram for the cyclic addition, the same stimulation signals having been used as in FIG. 2, that is to say a signal with N=10 oscillations and n=6 clock pulses from which signals with N=11 and N=9 oscillations were also derived. The conversion of the signals is performed using the same principle as illustrated in FIG. 3. In order to recover the signal N=11, in the upper part of FIG. 4 clock pulses are inserted at the points at which shortening of the oscillation by one clock pulse was carried out during the generation and, in order to recover the signal N=9, in the lower part of FIG. 4 clock pulses are removed where the oscillation was prolonged by one clock pulse during the generation. The points at which the prolongations of the clock pulse rate were undertaken are drawn in. If the reaction signal is equated to the stimulation signal, the illustrated signal profiles then represent the components of the reaction signal. The curve with N=11 results in the upper part, and the curve with N=9 in the lower part, again with an oscillation of initial length n=6. That is then also the basis for the cyclic addition.  \\n     [0050] It should be pointed out at this juncture that as early as in FIG. 2 the positions for the shortening of the oscillation by one clock pulse are drawn in in a fashion offset by one oscillation with reference to the position for the prolongation of the oscillation by one clock pulse. Such an offset, or a similar one, is necessary in order to ensure that when converting for the cyclic addition the partial segments that have already been prolonged or shortened once during generation of the oscillations are not prolonged or shortened again by one clock pulse.  \\n     [0051] A practical application of the above-named principle requires working with a larger number of clock pulses per oscillation and with a larger number of oscillations in the period prescribed for the measurement. Considering once again a stimulation with a 30 Hz flicker signal, the following values are sensible:  \\n     [0052] clock frequency 2 kHz.  \\n     [0053] The sampling frequency is 0.5 ms in order to obtain a rigid coupling of stimulation and recording of the reaction signal, that is to say clocking of the analog-to-digital converter.  \\n     [0054] An oscillation can be formed from 66 or 67 clock pulses. It is advantageous to use 67 clock pulses, since 67 itself is a prime number and this thus ensures that the number of the oscillations has no common divisor with 67, and thus the prolongation or shortening by one clock pulse is distributed uniformly over all the clock pulses of the oscillation in the overall cycle. Consequently, the error owing to the removal or insertion of clock pulses occurs equally often at all the points of the oscillation, and the error is eliminated virtually completely. The change by one clock pulse is a deviation by 1.5% from the nominal value in the case of 67 clock pulses, from which it follows that a change by two clock pulses corresponds to a deviation of 3% from the nominal value. If the aim is to generate a symmetrical oscillation in the case of 67 clock pulses, it is then necessary to operate half the oscillations with a pulse duty factor high:low=33:34, and the other half with a pulse duty factor high:low=34:33.  \\n     [0055] If a measuring period of 35 seconds is used, then 1050 oscillations result in the case of 30 Hz. Consequently, it is possible to generate 61 different oscillations in the case of a deviation of 3% from the nominal value, that is to say it is possible to control 61 different partial surfaces.  \\n     [0056]FIG. 5 shows a table with practical values of the oscillations under the said conditions. It can be seen that for N=1050 only oscillations with 67 clock pulses occur. For N=1051, there are 67 oscillations with 66 clock pulses, that is to say the oscillation was shortened 67 times by one clock pulse in each case, and there are 984 oscillations with 67 clock pulses. Thus, all the oscillations are derived from 70350 clock pulses. The spacing of the clock pulses to be faded out or faded in is specified in the last column. This spacing is yielded for an oscillating frequency N from:  \\n       Spacing   =       1050     \\uf603       N   i     -   1050     \\uf604       .                   \\n \\n     [0057] For the cases in which no integral value results for the spacing, the points are yielded from the rounded value of the multiple spacing. Consequently, all the oscillating frequencies between 1020 and 1080 can be derived. Only the integral values of this spacing are entered in the table.  \\n     [0058] Given a larger number of oscillations, it is also possible to generate still more different oscillations in conjunction with the same permissible deviation from the nominal value of the oscillation. Assuming that the 3% limit is not exceeded, it is then possible to derive 103 different oscillations with 1750 oscillations, that is to say a measuring period of approximately 58.45 seconds, that is to say 103 partial surfaces can be controlled.  \\n     [0059] It is a condition for applying this method that the state of the stimulator, that is to say of the image illustrated, can vary in a spacing of 0.5 msec. All parts of the image must be switched over synchronously in the process. This is possible only with a surface fitted with LEDs. A range of variants can be used here:  \\n     [0060] The LEDs are arranged and interconnected in the way in which the partial surfaces are to be illustrated. This is certainly simpler but, in return, not flexible.  \\n     [0061] Each LED element is driven separately, and partial surfaces are formed by the interaction of neighboring elements. This is certainly more complicated, but, in return, flexible.  \\n     [0062]FIG. 6 shows how it is possible to represent an image with 61 hexagons on a surface fitted with 33\\u00d729=957 LEDs. The assignments of the LEDs to the partial surfaces can be calculated by evaluating the associated surface fractions of the LEDs relative to the partial surfaces of the image.  \\n     [0063] Stimulators with a serial representation of the image as in the case of a display screen, a laser scanner or an LCD display screen are not suitable for this method.  \\n     [0064] Using this method, the following cycle is yielded for an example in which the stimulating image comprises 61 hexagons and the stimulation is performed with a 30 Hz flicker signal.  \\n     [0065] Generated in the control unit  3  that is illustrated in FIG. 1 is a clock pulse rate at 2 kHz, from which the 30 Hz signal with 67 clock pulses per oscillation is formed. This clock pulse rate comprises three sequential portions:  \\n     [0066] A first portion from which an oscillation is derived that serves the purpose of producing the steady state and adapting the eye. This portion includes, for example, 15 oscillations at 30 Hz.  \\n     [0067] A second portion that is used for the measurement. This portion includes 1050 oscillations in the case of the mean frequency of 30 Hz and comprises 67\\u00d71050=70350 clock pulses.  \\n     [0068] A third portion in which at least one more oscillation is generated and which serves the purpose of still detecting the last oscillation of the measurement without errors.  \\n     [0069] 67 clock pulses are now used for each mean oscillation in order to count the 30 Hz oscillation. Of these, for a pulse duty factor of 1:1 half of the oscillations are generated with 34 high clock pulses and 33 low clock pulses, and the other half of the oscillations are generated with 33 high clock pulses and 34 low clock pulses. The oscillations thus generated serve in the first and in the third portion of the clock pulse rate as stimulation signal for all partial surfaces. In the second portion, the oscillation thus generated is used only for one partial surface. For a second partial surface, one clock pulse less is used in each case in the spacing of 1050:1=1050 clock pulses. That is to say, the first oscillation is shortened by the first clock pulse and comprises only 66 clock pulses. The next shortening of an oscillation is performed at clock pulse number  1051 , then at clock pulse number  2101  and so on. This produces in the clock pulse rate of 70350 clock pulses 1051 oscillations that include small jumps with an error of 1.5% at the spacing of 1050 clock pulses. However, these jumps occur 67 times over the overall sequence and always in this case at a different point of the oscillation, since 67 is a prime number. Here, the total error is the 1050th part of 1.5% and is therefore negligible. The principle is shown in FIG. 2 for a greatly simplified example with 11 oscillations that consist in each case of 6 clock pulses.  \\n     [0070] One clock pulse less is used for a second partial surface at the spacing of 1050:2=525 clock pulses. This results in 1052 oscillations in the clock pulse rate. The spacing is 1050:3=350 clock pulses for a third partial surface, and 1050:4=262.5 clock pulses for a fourth partial surface. If this value is calculated with rounding, the spacing is alternately 263 and 262 clock pulses. Different oscillating frequencies of 1051 to 1080 are generated in this way in the clock pulse rate. It holds in general for the position A of the clock pulse to be inserted that: \\n       A=A   0   +n (1050 :\\u0394N ) \\n     [0071] Here, A 0  is the position of the first clock pulse to be inserted, \\u0394N is the deviation of the oscillating frequency from 1050, and n is the serial number for the clock pulse to be inserted, the expression in brackets always being rounded. The associated numerical values are represented in FIG. 5 as a table, only the integral values for the spacing being entered. The frequency at 1050 oscillations is 30 Hz and rises up to 30.857 Hz at 1080 oscillations.  \\n     [0072] 1049 oscillations can be generated using the same principle by prolonging an oscillation by in each case one clock pulse at the spacing of 1050:1=1050 clock pulses in the clock pulse rate of 70350 clock pulses. In this case, the first prolongation is carried out at clock pulse number  35 , the second at clock pulse number  1085 , etc. This principle is illustrated in FIG. 2 for N=9. 1048 oscillations result when use is made of a spacing of 1050:2=525 clock pulses. 1020 oscillations in the clock pulse rate of 70350 clock pulses are obtained for a spacing of 1050:30=35 clock pulses. The associated numerical values are specified in FIG. 5.  \\n     [0073] 61 different rates that have a constant clock pulse length of 70350 clock pulses result from this calculation. Each of these rates comprises an integral number of oscillations. The stimulator  2  illustrated in FIG. 1 is controlled with the frequency of 2 kHz. The stimulator  2  comprises an array of light-emitting diodes which is used to generate the image used for the stimulation. FIG. 6 shows an example in which hexagons are drawn in as partial surfaces, and the assignment to the partial surfaces is performed such that each light-emitting diode is assigned to that hexagon in which the majority of its area is included. All the light-emitting diodes of a partial surface are controlled in this case with the same signal string, and all the diodes of the overall image are controlled with the same clock pulse.  \\n     [0074] If the patient now looks at this image generated by the stimulator, corresponding reaction signals are generated by the individual partial surfaces of the retina. The sum of these reaction signals are amplified as aggregate signal, tapped at the cornea of the eye with the aid of an electrode, filtered and fed to an analog-to-digital converter. This analog-to-digital converter is controlled with the same clock pulse with which the light-emitting diodes are also controlled. Consequently, the tapped signal is brought into the same clock grid as was used for generating the stimulation image.  \\n     [0075] The reaction signals of the individual partial surfaces can now be recovered from this aggregate signal. The aggregate signal is added cyclically, specifically with a cycle of 67 clock pulses, for the reaction signal whose partial surface was stimulated with 1050 oscillations. This results in the 1050-fold multiple of the reaction signal of this partial surface. All other reaction signals are displaced in the case of this addition by one or more oscillations, and therefore make no contribution to the result, since a signal free from direct voltage always has components of equal size in the positive and negative range.  \\n     [0076] The distortion undertaken in the generation of the stimulation signal is canceled again for the purpose of recovering the reaction signals of the other partial surfaces. That is to say, in order to recover the signal of the partial surface stimulated with 1051 oscillations, one clock pulse whose value comprises the mean value of the preceding and the subsequent sample is now inserted at those points at which a shortening by one clock pulse was undertaken. The signal string is thereby prolonged to 70350+67 clock pulses and thus to 1051 oscillations of 67 clock pulses in each case. Applying the cyclic addition thereupon then produces the 1051-fold multiple of the reaction signal considered. All other components make no contribution to the result. The principle is illustrated in FIG. 3 in the upper part for N=21. The fact that signals are produced in this case that correspond to the mean stimulation rate of 1050 oscillations is shown in a simplified way in FIG. 2 in the upper part, in which the clock pulses were inserted for N=11. A similar procedure of inserting clock pulses is adopted for recovering the reaction signals of the other partial surfaces with an oscillating frequency&gt;1050.  \\n     [0077] The recovery of the signal with 1049 oscillations is performed such that one clock pulse is now removed at those points at which the stimulation signal was prolonged. The result is a signal string that comprises 70350\\u221267 clock pulses, and thus 1049 oscillations relating to 67 clock pulses. The 1049-fold multiple of the reaction signal of the relevant partial surface results from the cyclic addition. The principle is illustrated in FIG. 3 for N=19. The fact that signals are again produced in this case that correspond to the mean stimulation rate of 1050 oscillations is shown in a simplified fashion in FIG. 2 in the lower part, in which the clock pulses have been removed for N=9.  \\n     [0078] The jumps produced in this case are always produced over the entire rate at a different point in the 67 clock pulses and therefore produce virtually no error.  \\n     [0079] The evaluation of the measurement results can be performed by determining the amplitude and the latency of the peak value. Furthermore, the signal components of the fundamental wave and the harmonic wave and their phase angle can be determined with the aid of the Fourier transformation. It is possible in this case to make use of the advantage that a stimulation signal is being employed in which specific signal components are not, or virtually not, included, such as, for example, in the case of a square-wave signal with the pulse duty factor 1:1, in which the first harmonic wave is not included. This results in favorable conditions for drawing conclusions on nonlinearities in the reaction signal.  \\n     [0080] The method can also be applied advantageously to all other measurements in which use is made of cyclic stimulation and a steady state.

The objective of chemotherapy is the total extermination of clonogenic tumor or malignant cells, with minimal damage to the patient However, one of the major limitations of the chemotherapeutic approach for managing human cancer is the general inability of anticancer drugs to discriminate between normal and tumorous cells Anti-neoplastic agents have the lowest therapeutic indicies of any class of drugs used in humans and hence produce significant and potentially life-threatening toxicities. Certain commonly-used anti-neoplastic agents have unique and acute toxicities for specific tissues. For example, the vinca alkaloids possess significant toxicity for nervous tissues, while adriamycin has specific toxicity for heart tissue and bleomycin has for lung tissue. In general, almost all members of the major categories of anti-neoplastic agents have considerable toxicities for normal cells of gastrointestinal, epidermal and myelopoietic tissues.  \\n       [0004] Generally, the dose-limiting consideration for chemical management of cancer in humans is the toxicity that anti-neoplastic agents have for the pluripotent stern cells of myelopoietic tissue. This toxicity arises from the fact that most anticancer drugs function preferentially against proliferating cells but with no significant capacity to discriminate between cycling normal and cycling tumor tissues.  \\n       [0005] In U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,288,799, 5,859,065, 5,708,329, 5,747,543 and 5,618,846, all assigned to University of Manitoba and the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, there is described an improved method for the in vivo chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer in which there is first administered a compound which inhibits normal cell proliferation while promoting malignant cell proliferation, specifically a potent antagonist selective for intracellular histamine receptors, in an amount sufficient to inhibit the binding of intracellular histamine to the receptors in normal and malignant cells. Following sufficient time to permit the inhibition of binding of intracellular histamine, a chemotherapeutic agent is administered. An enhanced toxic effect on the cancer cells from the chemotherapeutic agent is obtained while any adverse effect of the chemotherapeutic agent on normal cells, particularly bone marrow and gastro-intestinal cells, is significantly ameliorated One useful compound which inhibits normal cell proliferation while promoting malignant cell proliferation is N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)-phenoxy]ethanamine, abbreviated herein as DPPE.  \\n       [0006] Brandes et at (1994, 1995) have shown that N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]-ethanamine (DPPE, tesmilifene), a tamoxifen analogue and intracellular antagonist of histamine binding to P450, potentiates the cytotoxicity of a variety of antineoplastic drugs in vitro (Brandes et al, 1987) and in vivo (Brandes et at, 1991). DPPE is a potent substrate for CYP 3A4 (Brandes et al., 2000), an isozyme that metabolizes arachidonic acid, hormones and drugs, including many antineoplastic agents Like other substrates for 3A4, DPPE also inhibits the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump (Menendez et al. 1998), whose overexpression is implicated in drug resistance  \\n       [0007] Hormone-refractory prostate cancer is defined by progressive malignancy despite adequate hormonal blockade, confirmed by demonstrably suppressed serum testosterone levels less than 30 ng/ml. Traditionally, this clinical entity has been characterized by symptoms of tumor progression (most often bone pain)  \\n       [0008] In addition to radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to have anti-cancer efficacy against advanced prostate cancer after failure of hormonal therapy, with agents such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and the taxanes, causing reduction of symptoms in up to 50% of treated cases and objective tumor reduction in 10-20% of cases (Beer and Raghavan, 2002) Mitoxantrone, a well characterized anthracenedione, has been shown to have significant anticancer efficacy against prostate cancer, both in phase II (Osborne et al, 1983; Raghavan et al, 1989) and phase III clinical trials (Tannock et al, 1996; Kantoff et al, 1999). In patients with symptomatic bone metastases, mitoxantrone in combination with prednisone causes a reduction of symptoms in up to 40% of cases (Tannock et al, 1996; Raghavan et al, 1989), PSA response in 30 to 40% and median survival of around 10 months. In series that include asymptomatic patients with bone metastases, the median survival may be as long as 16 to 18 months, depending on the case mix (Kantoff et al, 1999), although stage migration could account for the apparent improvement in survival after chemotherapy in asymptomatic patients. Based on these findings, this agent was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  \\n       [0009] In a phase II study of DPPE and cyclophosphamide in 20 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, a PSA response rate of 50% and pain response rate of 85% were observed (Brandes et al., 1995). In a phase III prospective randomized trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada, comparing DPPE/doxorubicin (N=151) to doxorubicin (N=152) in breast cancer patients, DPPE/doxorubicin was shown to have the unusual effect of significantly increasing median survival (23.6 vs. 15.6 months, P&lt;0.03) without a major impact on the early endpoints of response rate and progression-free survival (PCT/CA02/01725 filed Nov. 6, 2002).  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0010] It has now been surprisingly found, in a Phase II, non-randomized clinical trial of DPPE combined with the standard regimen of mitoxantrone and prednisone in the treatment of hormone-refractive prostate cancer that overall survival in a significant number of patients was increased as compared to the work reported earlier without DPPE pretreatment. The patients exhibiting longevity all had significant pain symptoms and tended to have high PSA and alkaline phosphates levels, indicative of a high disease burden and poor prognosis for survival beyond one year.  \\n       [0011] Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of achieving enhanced survival in a proportion of human patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, which comprises:  \\n       [0012] (a) first administering to said patients at least one diphenyl compound of the formula:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0013] wherein X and Y are each fluorine, chlorine or bromine, Z is an alkylene group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms or \\u2550C\\u2550O, or the phenyl groups are joined to form a tricyclic ring, o and p are 0 or 1, R 1  and R 2  are each an alkyl group containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms or are joined together to form a heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen atom and n is 1, 2 or 3, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, and  \\n       [0014] (b) following sufficient time to permit inhibition of binding of intracellular histamine, subsequently administering to the patient a chemotherapeutic agent active in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  \\n       [0015] In the application of the present invention, the diphenyl compound and the chemotherapeutic agent are generally administered by intravenous infusion. In one preferred procedure, a solution of the diphenyl compound is administered to the patient over a desired period of time prior to administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and a solution of the chemotherapeutic agent in combination with the diphenyl compound then is administered for the period of administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. If desired, a solution of the diphenyl compound is administered after completion of the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent for a desired period of time to ameliorate side effects from the chemotherapeutic agent administration. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS  \\n     [0016]FIG. 1 is a graphical representation of the results of the Phase II trial referred to herein, illustrating the estimated probability of survival as a function of months from start of treatment. \\n    \\n    \\n     GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION  \\n     [0017] In the present invention, a diphenyl compound is used which is a potent antagonist of histamine binding at the intracellular histamine receptor and is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit the binding of intracellular histamine at the intracellular binding rate (H IC ) in normal cells. Such compounds exhibit a pK 1  of al least about 5, preferably at least about 5.5.  \\n     [0018] Specific potent compounds which are useful in the present invention are diphenyl compounds of the formula:  \\n                 \\n \\n     [0019] wherein X and Y are each fluorine, chlorine or bromine, Z is an alkylene group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms or \\u2550C\\u2550O, o and p are 0 or 1, R 1  and R 2  are each alkyl group containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms or are joined together to form a hetero-ring with the nitrogen atom and n is 1, 2 or 3. Pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the diphenyl compounds may be employed.  \\n     [0020] Alternatively, the benzene rings may be joined to form a tricyclic ring in accordance with the structure:  \\n                 \\n \\n     [0021] In one preferred embodiment, the group  \\n                 \\n \\n     [0022] is a diethylamino group, although other alkylamino groups may be employed, such as dimethylamino, and, in another preferred embodiment, a morpholino group, although other heterocyclic ring groups may be employed, such as piperazino. o and p are usually 0 when Z is an alkylene group and o may be 2. In one particularly preferred embodiment, Z is \\u2014CH 2 \\u2014, n is 2, o and p are each 0 and  \\n                 \\n \\n     [0023] is a diethylamino group. This compound, namely N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)-phenoxy]ethanamine, which may be in the form of the free base or in the form of its hydrochloride salt, is abbreviated herein as DPPE. In addition to a methyl group linking the benzene rings, other linking groups may be employed, such as \\u2550C\\u2550O. Other substitutents may be provided on the benzene rings in addition to the halogen atoms, for example, an imidazole group.  \\n     [0024] The diphenyl compound employed in the present invention is administered to the patient in any convenient manner, such as by intravenous injection of a solution thereof in an aqueous pharmaceutically-acceptable vehicle. The diphenyl compound is administered to the patient over a period of time before administration of the chemotherapeutic agent  \\n     [0025] The chemotherapeutic agent employed herein is one which is active in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Such chemotherapeutic agents active in cancer include anthancene diones, such as mitoxantrone The chemotherapeutic agent, or a mixture of such agents, is administered in any manner consistent with its normal manner of administration in conventional prostate cancer therapy, often by intravenous infusion of a solution thereof. One specific chemotherapeutic agent which may be used is mitoxantrone, which may be used in combination with prednisone.  \\n     [0026] The administration of the diphenyl compound to the patient prior to administration of the chemotherapeutic agent is necessary in order to permit the diphenyl compound to inhibit the binding of intracellular histamine in normal and malignant cells and thereby, in effect, shut down the proliferation of the normal cells, but increase proliferation of malignant cells.  \\n     [0027] The length of time prior to administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) that the diphenyl compound is administered depends on the diphenyl compound, its mode of administration and the size of the patient. Generally, the diphenyl compound is administered to the patient for about 30 to about 90 minutes, preferably about 60 minutes, prior to administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s).  \\n     [0028] The quantity of diphenyl compound administered to the patient depends on the side effects to be ameliorated, but should be at least sufficient to inhibit binding of intracellular histamine in normal cells. The quantity required to achieve the beneficial effects of the present invention depends upon the diphenyl compound employed, the chemotherapeutic agent(s) employed and the quantity of such agent(s) employed.  \\n     [0029] In general, the quantity of diphenyl compound employed in humans is from about 8 to about 320 mg/M 2  of human to which the diphenyl compound is administered, with about 8 and 240 mg/M 2  being the optimal dose for gastro-intestinal and bone marrow protection, respectively. Over this dose range, the present invention is able to achieve an enhanced chemotherapeutic effect on hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells while, at the same time, also protecting normal cells from damage by the chemotherapeutic agent(s) in a wide variety of circumstances where traditional chemotherapy leads to damage of normal cells or tissues not involved in the disease process.  \\n     [0030] In the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer, the diphenyl compound preferably is used in an amount of about 3 to about 10 mg/kg of patient administered intravenously over a period of about 30 to about 90 minutes prior to administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and continuing for the period of administration of The chemotherapy agent(s). In the specific Phase II clinical trial described herein, there was employed 5.3 mg/kg of DPPE in the form of the base (equivalent to 6 mg/kg of DPPE in the form of its hydrochloride), administered intravenously as an aqueous solution thereof over 80 minutes, with the last twenty minutes being accompanied by infusion of mitoxantrone.  \\n     [0031] The treatment of the patients with DPPE and mitoxantrone may include standard therapy with prednisone or the glucocorticoid, such as prednisolone or related cortisone.  \\n     EXAMPLES  \\n     Example I  \\n     [0032] This Example describes a Phase II clinical trial of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  \\n     [0033] A Phase II trial was conducted as a non-randomized, single-arm clinical trial, according to a protocol that was approved by the Clinical Investigations Committees and the Institutional Ethical Review Boards of the University of Southern California and the University of Manitoba. Patients underwent history and physical examination, detailed assessment of hematological and biochemical parameters, bone scans, and CT scans of abdomen and pelvis. Based on prior preclinical and clinical modeling experience (Brandes et al, 1994, 1995, 1996), patients received a 3-weekly regimen (maximum number of cycles, 12) consisting of DPPE (5.3 mg/kg infused intravenously over 80 minutes) and mitoxantrone (12 mg/m 2  i.v. during the last 20 minutes of DPPE infusion), as well as daily oral prednisone (5 mg bid). To prevent or ameliorate motion sickness associated with the DPPE infusion, patients received i.v. ondanseiron (8 mg) or equivalent and i.v. lorazepam (2 to 3 mg) pre-treatment, and i.v. metoclopramide (20 mg) post-treatment.  \\n     [0034] Patients were accrued in two phases: (i) 16 cases began therapy in an initial component between September, 1998 and July, 1999; (ii) 13 cases began therapy in a continuation of the study with the same protocol being used through the entire study.  \\n     [0035] The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the pain response rate and to determine the feasibility and safety of administering this combination; secondary endpoints were to assess the duration of the pain responses, quality of life by the EORTC questionnaire, survival benefit, and to determine the PSA response rate. The pain response required a decrease in the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) score on the McGill-Melzack questionnaire in the setting of stable or decreasing analgesic usage (Bureau et al, 1992). PPI scores and analgesic usage were recorded by each patient prior to commencement of therapy and then daily Quality of life assessments were carried out using the EORTC QLQ-30 core questionnaire, version -2, and the EORTC Prostate Cancer Specific Module (PCSM) (Aaronson et al, 1993, King, 1996). Patients completed these indices every three weeks. Because of the difficulties of accurately quantifying response in bone metastases (in the context that tumor-related pain was a requirement for entry), no systematic attempt was made to quantify objective response.  \\n     [0036] Patients were eligible for this protocol if they met the following criteria: biopsy-proven prostate cancer; symptomatic painful metastases requiring narcotic analgesia (with a PPI score of \\u22671); proven castrate testosterone levels (&lt;30 ng/ml); ECOG Performance Status\\u22662; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVF)&gt;50%; white blood cell count of \\u22673.0\\u00d710 9 /L, absolute granulocyte count of &gt;1.5\\u00d710 9 /L, platelets&gt;100\\u00d710 9 /L, and hemoglobin\\u22679 g/dl; serum creatinine&lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin&lt;2.0 times the upper limit of normal and AST&lt;4.0 times the upper limit of normal; documented progression; ani-androgen withdrawal with documented lack of response (&gt;4 weeks for flutamide; &gt;6 weeks for bicalutamide); \\u22661 prior chemotherapy regimen, prior radiotherapy (&gt;4 weeks, or strontium 89&gt;8 weeks, before study entry); no prior anthracyclines or anthracenediones; written informed consent.  \\n     [0037] Patients were excluded if they had a history of prior intercurrent malignancy (apart from treated non-melanoma skin cancer), known central nervous system metastases, acite intercurrent medical disorder, contra-indications to corticosteroids, unstable impending pathological fractures, prior exposure to DPPE, and concurrent participation in other investigational trial.  \\n     [0038] The characteristics of the treated patients are summarized in Table 1. The median age at presentation was 74 years, with the fourth quartile being 77 years or older. Ten per cent of patients were older than 80 years, suggesting that this series was not confounded by an age selection bias in favor of youth. On the other hand, the majority of the patients had ECOG performance status 1, suggesting case selection in favor of pre-treatment robustness. Despite the good performance status of these patients, the median serum alkaline phosphatase was 344 IU/l and the median PSA was 210 ng/ml (with one quarter having values \\u2267500 ng/ml), suggesting that this series did not select for minimal metastatic disease. All but one patient had bone metastases, and a small proportion of patients had other sites of soft tissue involvement, including lymph nodes, lung and liver. All patients had pain at entry, which distinguishes this series from most recent reports (See Table 2). The median PPI score at entry was 2 (range 0 to 5). Only one patient self-recorded a PPI score of 0 at entry, although it was documented in the chart by the treating physician that he initially had significant pain, requiring narcotic analgesics, immediately prior to entry in the trial.  \\n     Example II  \\n     [0039] This Example describes the results of the Phase II clinical trial described in Example I.  \\n     [0040] The results of the Phase II clinical trial described in Example I are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 and FIG. 1. As can be seen, 79% of patients sustained a pain response, 66% of patients reduced analgesia, 56% bad a PSA reduction of \\u226750% and 48% had a \\u226775% PSA reduction The actuarial median survival was 12 months, although it was noted that 2-year survival was 24% and 3-year survival was 10%.  \\n     [0041] The pattern of pain relief was dramatic. Of the 15 patients with PPI of 2-5, ten reduced by more than 1.5; of the 13 patients with PPI of 1-1.9, five reduced by a PPI score of \\u22671. One patient, while complaining of significant pain at baseline, scored himself with a PPI of 0, but was noted to have no pain after two cycles of treatment. In parallel to these results, 11 patients discontinued narcotic analgesics and 8 reduced their use (a total of 66% of cases reduced the use of narcotic analgesia).  \\n     [0042] The pattern of toxicity is summarized in Table 4. The only unusual side effect was the presence of visual hallucinations, which were attributable to DPPE and seen in 22% of cases, usually in the first cycle only. Apart from hallucinations, Grade III toxicities consisted of asthenia, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Grade IV leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were noted in one case each. Cardiac toxicity did not appear to be enhanced, although one patient who had received 8 cycles of DPPE/mitoxantrone developed biventricular cardiac failure after receiving indirect cardiac irradiation during radiotherapy for acute spinal cord compression. There were no other cases of cardiac failure, and it should be noted that 60% of patients received &gt;6 cycles, with a range from 2 to 12 cycles of treatment. There were no toxic deaths.  \\n     [0043] The pattern of five patients experienced serious adverse events defined as possibly related to study drugs. These consisted of hospitalization for fever in one case, severe fatigue in two cases and a possible embolic event in another. These patients recovered or became stable following appropriate treatment. A further patient experienced shortness of breath, weakness and anorexia and treatment was withdrawn at the subject&#39;s request. This patient subsequently died.  \\n     [0044] We have compared outcomes from the Phase II trial described herein with three major previous series (Raghavan et al, 1989, Tannock et al, 1996; Kantoff et al, 1999) to set the general data into a context. While recognizing limitations of non-randomized comparison, in conducting this Phase II trial of 29 patients treated with the combination of mitoxantrone, DPPE and prednisone, we attempted to include only patients that are comparable to those treated in two previous studies (Raghavan et al, 1989; Tannock et al, 1996). While the series of Kantoff et al (1999) is important and instructive, it appears that the patient population was quite different, with a lower tumor burden: 40% of cases did not require analgesia at presentation, only 90% had bone metastases, median PSA was 150 ng/ml and median alkaline phosphatase was 167 IU/l.  \\n     [0045] We observed a substantial reduction of pain (61%), analgesic consumption (66%), PSA (56% with PSA reduction of \\u226750% and 48% with PSA reduction of \\u226775%) and serum alkaline phosphatase (36%\\u226750%). Of particular importance, one quarter of the patients were aged 77 years or older, a population not suited to the more aggressive taxane-estramustine based regimens that have become relatively standard therapy in the younger cohort of patients with prostate cancer.  \\n     [0046] While the actuarial median survival was not apparently improved (12 months), 28% of cases lived 18 months or longer. 24% lived 2 years or longer, and 10% lived beyond 3 years. These figures are substantially better than previously reported for similar patient populations treated with mitoxantrone plus prednisone (Raghavan et al, 1989; Tannock et al, 1996). The survival data in our study are also of interest in light of the recent phase III randomized National Cancer Institute of Canada study described in the aforementioned PCT/CA02/01725, where patients with advanced breast cancer treated with DPPE/doxorubicin had a significant increase in median survival compared with patients treated with doxorubicin alone. This unusual phenomenon of an apparent increase in the proportion of long-term survivors in the absence of early endpoint differences is currently under investigation in another planned clinical study combining DPPE with an anthracycline. The patients exhibiting longevity all had significant pain symptoms and tended to have high PSA and alkaline phosphates levels, indicative of a high disease burden and poor prognosis for survival beyond one year.  \\n     [0047] Despite these observations, the pattern of toxicity, listed in Table 4, did not appear significantly different from that previously reported for patients treated with mitoxantrone-prednisone (Raghavan et al, 1989; Tannock et al, 1996; Kantoff et al, 1999), apart from the presence of hallucinations in 10% of cases. The hallucinations have been identified in other cohorts of DPPE-treated cases (Brandes et al, 1995, 1996; Khoo et al. 1999) and are usually described by patients as humorous or pleasant, and are mainly seen with the first cycle of treatment. There have been no patients who have declined to continue treatment because of this phenomenon  \\n     [0048] The high proportion of patients experiencing 75% PSA reduction and dramatic amelioration of pain suggests that this novel regimen may be more effective than mitoxantrone-prednisone alone, especially when the characteristics of advanced age and extensive bony metastases are considered. Recently, Beer et al (2003) have reported comparable activity of the combination of docetaxel and calcitriol against metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, although it appears that they have treated patients with a lower tumor burden and less extensive symptoms.  \\n     [0049] The extent of PSA reduction and decreased symptoms with DPPE/mitoxantrone/prednisone compare favorably to mitoxantrone/prednisone-treated cases reported in the literature, wherein PSA \\u226775% reduction occurs in less than 20% of patients and pain reduction in up to 40%. Although median survival is not different from previous experience, improved 2- and 3-year survivals were herein.  \\n     SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE  \\n     [0050] In summary of this disclosure, the present invention provides a novel method of treating hormone-refractory prostate cancer by the sequential administration of DPPE and analog compounds and mitoxantrone, to result in increased survival in a proportion of patients. Modifications are possible within the scope of the invention  \\n               TABLE 1                       PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:                                                NUMBER OF CASES   \\u200229           AGE           Median   \\u2002\\u2003\\u200274 years           Range   \\u200252-83 years           Interquartile range   \\u200261-77 years           \\u226780 years   \\u200210%           BASELINE ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS           Median   \\u20031           Mode   \\u20031           Range   \\u20030-2           BASELINE PSA (ng/ml)           Median   210           Range   \\u200211-3871           interquartile range   \\u200277-593           \\u2267100 ng/ml   \\u200269%           \\u2267500 ng/ml   \\u200224%           BASELINE ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE (U)           Median   344           Range   \\u200222-3018           &gt;500 U   \\u200234%           SITES Of DISEASE           Bone metastases   \\u200297%           Liver metastases   \\u200210%?

With this design, the radially outer delimitation of the cooling channel is formed by a ring wall molded onto the outer region of the piston head and serves as a carrier for the piston rings. Towards the side of the pin boss, the cooling channel is closed off by a ring-shaped cooling channel cover structured as a support element. The inside edge of the support element is held by a ring nut, which is screwed onto a ring-shaped projection, molded onto the piston head, and the outer edge of the support element supports the ring wall by way of the pin-boss-side face of the ring wall, to prevent the outer region of the piston head from being deformed during the work cycle of the piston.  \\n       [0004] A disadvantage of this design is that within the scope of the very complicated assembly of the known piston, the cooling channel cover must first be pushed onto the bottom of the upper part of the piston, which faces the piston head, before the ring nut can be screwed onto the projection and thereby the cooling channel cover can be screwed on tightly. Only then can the remaining assembly of the piston take place, during which the piston shaft is pushed onto the bottom of the upper part of the piston and attached to it by means of a piston pin sleeve.  \\n       [0005] Proceeding from this, the invention is based on the task of creating a one-piece piston having a cooling channel, wherein the channel can quickly and easily be closed off with a cover, which improves the rigidity of the piston.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0006] This task is accomplished in that pin bosses are molded onto the piston head, by way of pin boss supports, the faces of which bosses are arranged set back relative to the radially outer edge of the piston head, wherein the pin bosses are connected by way of skirt elements that are molded onto the piston head by way of skirt connections that have concave recesses in the region between the skirt elements and the piston head. In addition, the cooling channel cover comprises at least two arc-shaped cover elements, the inner edge of which is supported in a recess worked partly into the pin boss support and partly into the skirt connection, and the outer edge of which supports the ring wall by way of the pin-boss-side face of this ring wall. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0007] Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings which disclose at least one embodiment of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the drawings are designed for the purpose of illustration only and not as a definition of the limits of the invention.  \\n     [0008] In the drawings, wherein similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views:  \\n     [0009]FIG. 1 is a side cross-sectional representation of a piston for an internal combustion engine, having a cooling channel cover shown in a cross-sectional diagram comprising two halves, which shows two longitudinal sections of the piston, offset by 90 \\u00b0;  \\n     [0010]FIG. 2 is a representation of the cooling channel and the cooling channel cover on a larger scale, after its final assembly;  \\n     [0011]FIG. 3 is a cooling channel cover that comprises two semi-circular halves; and  \\n     [0012]FIG. 4 is a side cross-sectional diagram, in a larger scale, of the cooling channel, with an arrangement of the cooling channel cover that results within the scope of the assembly of the piston. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0013] Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a piston  1  for an internal combustion engine, structured in one piece, in a cross-sectional diagram that comprises two halves, the left half showing a cross-section of the piston  1  along a longitudinal axis  2  of a pin bore  3 , and the right half showing a cross-section of the piston  1  offset from the left half by 90\\u00b0. Piston  1  is made of steel, and has a combustion bowl  5  in the region of piston head  4 . A ring-shaped cooling channel  6  is arranged in the radially outer region of the piston head  4 . The radially outer delimitation of this channel is formed by a ring wall  7  molded onto the piston head  4 , and the radially inner delimitation of this channel is formed partly by a ring rib  8 , partly by a pin boss support  9 ,  9 \\u2032, and partly by a skirt connection  17 ,  17 \\u2032. With this design, ring wall  7  serves as a piston ring carrier.  \\n     [0014] A pin boss  10 ,  10 \\u2032, having a pin bore,  3 ,  3 \\u2032, in each instance, is molded onto piston head  4 , in each instance, by way of the pin boss supports  9 ,  9 \\u2032. Faces  11  of pin bosses  10 ,  10 \\u2032 are arranged set back relative to ring wall  7 , in the direction of the longitudinal piston axis  12 . Pin bosses  10 ,  10 \\u2032 are connected with one another by way of skirt elements  13 ,  13 \\u2032, which are connected with piston head  4  by way of a skirt connection  17 ,  17 \\u2032, in each instance. Piston head  1  has recesses  15  between skirt elements  13 ,  13 \\u2032 and the piston-head-side region  14  of piston  1 .  \\n     [0015] Adjacent to pin bosses  10 ,  10 \\u2032, cooling channel  6  is covered by a cooling channel cover  18 , which is structured as a solid support element and comprises two semi-circular cover elements  19  and  20 , (See FIG. 3). Cooling channel cover  18 , which has an opening  16  (see FIG. 1) to allow cooling oil to flow in, and an opening  16 \\u2032, shown only in FIG. 3, for the oil to flow out, is structured conically, similar to the edge of a plate, and rests with its inner edge  21  in a circumferential recess  22 , which is worked partly into pin boss supports  9 ,  9 \\u2032 and partly into skirt connections  17 ,  17 \\u2032. Outer edge  23  of cooling channel cover  18  forms a contact surface for the pin-boss-side face of ring wall  7 , so that cooling channel cover  18  prevents load-related deformations of the outside region of piston head  4  and of ring wall  7 , to a great extent, in its capacity as a support element, particularly during the work cycle of piston  1 .  \\n     [0016] The enlarged cross-sectional diagram according to FIG. 2 shows that piston-pin-side face  24  of ring wall  7  has a step-shaped undercut  25  that corresponds, in its shape, to a recess  26 , also step-shaped, made in outer wall  23  of cooling channel cover  18 , so that after final assembly of piston  1 , undercut  25  and recess  26  engage into one another and contribute to the prevention of load-related deformations of the outer region of piston head  4 . Furthermore, it is evident in FIG. 2 that oil drain holes  28  are arranged between groove  27  for the oil ring (not shown in the figure) and cooling channel  6 .  \\n     [0017] Cooling channel cover  18  shown in FIG. 3 comprises of two semi-circular cover elements  19  and  20 . However, it can also be structured in three or more parts. The step-shaped recess  26  worked into outer edge  23  and opening  16  for oil to flow in and opening  16 \\u2032 for oil to flow out can be seen.  \\n     [0018] The method of assembly of cooling channel cover  18  shall be illustrated using FIG. 4. The cover is first brought into contact, with its radially inner edge  21 , against an edge of recess  22  in piston head  4  and, with its radially outer edge  23 , against face  24  of ring wall  7 , as shown in FIG. 4. Subsequently, inner edge  21  is pressed axially in the direction of piston head  4 , whereby cooling channel cover  18  is preloaded and can be radially pushed inward, so that it comes to rest in recess  22  with its inner edge  21 . In this position, cooling channel cover  18  is fixed in place wherein it snaps from step  29  formed by recess  26  into undercut  25  of face  24 . Cooling channel cover  18  is structured so that after the final assembly, it maintains a slight deformation and thereby a permanent preload securing cooling channel  18  to piston head  4 .  \\n     [0019] Accordingly, while at least one embodiment of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that many changes and modifications may be made thereunto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.  \\n     [0020] Reference Symbol List  \\n     [0021] 1  piston  \\n     [0022] 2  longitudinal axis  \\n     [0023] 3 ,  3 \\u2032 Pin bore  \\n     [0024] 4  piston head  \\n     [0025] 5  combustion bowl  \\n     [0026] 6  cooling channel  \\n     [0027] 7  ring wall  \\n     [0028] 8  ring rib  \\n     [0029] 9 \\u2032 pin boss support  \\n     [0030] 10 \\u2032 pin boss  \\n     [0031] 11  face, or opening  \\n     [0032] 12  longitudinal piston axis  \\n     [0033] 13 \\u2032 skirt element  \\n     [0034] 14  piston-head-side region  \\n     [0035] 15  recess  \\n     [0036] 16 \\u2032 opening  \\n     [0037] 17 \\u2032 skirt connection  \\n     [0038] 18  cooling channel cover; or annular ring  \\n     [0039] 19  cover element  \\n     [0040] 20  cover element  \\n     [0041] 21  inner edge of the cooling channel cover  18   \\n     [0042] 22  recess  \\n     [0043] 23  outer edge of the cooling channel cover  18   \\n     [0044] 24  face of the ring wall  7   \\n     [0045] 25  undercut of ring wall  7   \\n     [0046] 26  recess of cooling channel cover  \\n     [0047] 27  groove  \\n     [0048] 28  oil drain hole  \\n     [0049] 29  step; or flange\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005042244-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A method for controlling Acarina, which includes allowing a gaseous compound having the formula (I)  \\n                 \\n \\nwherein  ---------  is a single bond or a double bond, to be present at a concentration of 0.001-20,000 \\u03bcg/L in a space where Acarina repellence is intended, and an apparatus capable of effectively controlling Acarina are provided.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"1 .

In recent years, along with the domestic prevelance of the idea of sanitation and increasing environmental cleanliness, the morbidity of infectious diseases mediated by Acarina is decreasing. On the other hand, increase in the allergic diseases caused thereby as allergen has been observed, and one of the main causes of allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, rhinitis and the like is considered to be indoor Acarina. The increased number of indoor Acarina is largely attributable to the improved living environment, and increasing environments preferable for Acarina, as evidenced by prevalence of highly airtight houses, improved performance of indoor heating system during winter, increased use of fiber products for westernization of interior design and the like, is considered to have enlarged the damage. Thus, countermeasures for them are strongly desired.  \\n      As a countermeasure, acaricidal agents, such as organophosphates, carbamates and the like, have been conventionally used widely. However, since these agents mostly contain a highly toxic chemical as an active ingredient, they are associated with the problem of damage to human and livestock. While a number of low toxic pyrethroid agents have appeared in recent years, as long as their effectiveness expression mechanism is based on the biocidal activity, concerns about the health of human and livestock as well as influence on the environment cannot be eliminated.  \\n      On the other hand, Acarina control agents based not on acaricidal activity but on repellent effect are known. Repellents free of biocidal activity are expected to simultaneously provide high safety and pest controllability. The present. inventors have found that a compound having the following structure  \\n                 \\n \\n has Acarina repellency and proposed an Acarina control agent containing this compound (see JP-A-10-316507.). This Acarina control agent has more advantages as compared to conventionally known organophosphate-, pyrethroid- and carbamate-type and other types of acaricides in that (1) it has lower acaricidal activity, and Acarina can be removed without leaving Acarina cadaver, which is a potent allergen, in the environment, (2) Acarina do not acquire resistance easily, (3) it is highly safe to human and livestock, and the like. \\n \\n      The above-mentioned publication discloses that farnesylacetone can be used for controlling Acarina. However, it does not disclose that the Acarina control agent can be used for efficient and effective control of Acarina by maintaining farnesylacetone in an effective concentration range in a space where the presence of Acarina is not desired.  \\n     DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The present inventors have conducted intensive studies and found that Acarina can be particularly effectively controlled by allowing a gaseous compound having the formula  \\n                 \\n \\n wherein  \\n                 \\n \\n is a single bond or a double bond, (hereinafter to be also referred to as compound (I)) to be present at a particular concentration of 0.001-20,000 \\u03bcg/L in a space where Acarina repellence is intended, and further that a compound having the formula (I\\u2032)  \\n                 \\n \\n (phytone; hereinafter to be also referred to as compound (I\\u2032)) has a superior Acarina control effect, which resulted in the completion of the present invention. \\n \\n      Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of effectively controlling Acarina, which comprises maintaining the concentration of compound (I) within a repellence effective concentration range for a long time in a space where Acarina repellence is intended, a method and an apparatus for efficiently achieving such effective concentration, and an Acarina control agent containing compound (I\\u2032) as an active ingredient.

[10] An Acarina control agent comprising phytone as an active ingredient.   \\n\\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DISCLOSURE OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  explains an Acarina repellence test by an improved glass tube method.  \\n       FIG. 2  explains an Acarina repellence test by an improved invasion prevention method. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The compound (I) is a known compound and is chemically synthesized at a large scale as a starting material for synthesizing, for example, a side chain of vitamin E and vitamin K 2 . The compound (I\\u2032) is compound (I) wherein  \\n                 \\n \\n is not a double bond. Therefore, the agent containing compound (I) to be used for the method of the present invention can be used as an Acarina control agent containing compound (I\\u2032) as an active ingredient (hereinafter to be simply referred to as the agent of the present invention). Therefore, a simple reference to compound (I) in the present specification also refers to compound (I\\u2032), unless particularly deviated from the context. When  \\n                 \\n \\n is a double bond, compound (I) includes plural kinds of geometrical isomers based on different bonding sites to the double bond (cis, trans). The compound (I) to be used for the present invention may be any of these geometrical isomers, or a mixture of two or more kinds of these geometrical isomers, where the mixing ratio is not particularly limited. \\n \\n      The \\u201cgaseous\\u201d of the gaseous compound (I) of the present invention includes a mist state depending on the vaporization conditions, surrounding environmental conditions, and the like.  \\n      The concentration of gaseous compound (I) in a space where Acarina repellence is intended is at least not less than 0.001 \\u03bcg/L, preferably not less than 0.01 \\u03bcg/L and not more than 20,000 \\u03bcg/L at most, preferably not more than 2,000 \\u03bcg/L. When the concentration is less than 0.001 \\u03bcg/L, an Acarina controlling effect is not found and when it exceeds 20,000 \\u03bcg/L, the odor compound (I) generates becomes unpleasantly strong and is not practical.  \\n      The space where Acarina repellence is intended is free of any particular limitation as regards size, shape and the like, because the amount of use and method of use of compound (I) can be adjusted so that the above-mentioned concentration can be achieved.  \\n      The agent comprising compound (I) in the context of the present specification refers to a single compound of compound (I) and a dilute solution obtained by diluting compound (I) with a diluent, or one containing other carriers, including not only a liquid but a solid. As the diluent, any inorganic or organic diluent can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I). As the diluent, a solvent, an aroma retention agent, a moisturizer and the like can be used. Of these, those having high safety, which are used as starting materials for cosmetics, are desirable, and, for example, alcohols such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and the like, ketones such as acetone and the like, esters (low boiling point) such as ethyl acetate and the like; silicone oil, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, jojoba oil, squalane, liquid paraffin, rape seed oil, cotton seed oil, tung oil, camellia oil, other vegetable oil (high boiling point oil) and the like can be mentioned. It is also possible to add an additive such as emulsifier and the like to a diluent for compound (I) and use the mixture as a water dispersible agent. As the additive, for example, alkylbenzenesulfonates, \\u03b1-olefinesulfonates, alkanesulfonates, tetraammonium salts having long-chain alkyl groups, aliphatic mono- or di-ethanolamide, (poly)ethylene glycol ester or ether of fatty acid, glycerin ester of mono-fatty acid, sorbitan esters of fatty acid, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, alkylphenyl polyoxyethylene ether, N-alkyl betaine-type or sulfobetain-type surfactants and the like can be mentioned. Of these, those having high safety, which are used as starting materials for cosmetics, such as sodium octylsulfosuccinate, polyoxyethylensorbitan monolaurate and the like are preferable. In addition, the agent comprising compound (I) can further contain auxiliary agent, stabilizer, thickener, coloring agent, flavor and the like, as necessary.  \\n      As a method of vaporizing a sufficient amount of a liquid agent comprising compound (I) to achieve the concentration of gaseous compound (I) in the aforementioned space where Acarina repellence is intended, any method capable of achieving the object can be used without a particular limitation. Such method and an apparatus to achieve the method are concretely and exemplarily shown in the following.  \\n      A method comprising placing an agent comprising compound (I) in a container having a porous wall, such as unglazed pottery, sintered metal and the like, and allowing compound (I) to vaporize from the about entire outer surface upon oozing of the agent comprising compound (I) out on the outer surface of the container. The container having a porous wall in this method corresponds to the reservoir means for an agent comprising compound (I) in the apparatus of the present invention, and is also a vaporization area expanding means. The reservoir means for an agent comprising compound (I) is not limited to the above-mentioned container and is not particularly limited as long as it can reserve an agent comprising compound (I) until vaporization. For example, the means may be a reservoir means embodied by preserving an agent comprising compound (I) in a container such as a glass or plastic bottle and the like, distributing the agent in the container closed tightly and cutting open a part of the container when in use, or opening the lid and transferring the contents into vaporization area expanding means or a container, and a vaporization area expanding means to be explained in the following also can be a reservoir means depending on the embodiment thereof.  \\n      As a different method, a method comprising immersing one end of a cloth, string or sponge like vaporization area expanding means having a wide surface area in a reservoir means for an agent comprising compound (I), thereby allowing the vaporization area expanding means to absorb the agent comprising compound (I) by a capillary phenomenon, or continuously supplying an agent comprising compound (I) from the reservoir means for the agent comprising compound (I) to the vaporization area expanding means, thereby allowing the agent to be absorbed, and vaporizing compound (I) from the surface of the vaporization area expanding means can be mentioned. Examples of the vaporization area expanding means used for this method include natural fibers such as pulp, cotton, hemp and the like; synthetic fibers such a polyester and the like; paper, fabric, knitted product, felt and non-woven fabric produced from glassfiber and the like; a sponge formed article which is a porous structure made from a synthetic resin or glass; and further, a strand, knitted product, fabric of hollow fiber produced from synthetic resin or glass, and the like can be mentioned. These are not particularly limited as long as they can expand the vaporization area of compound (I). While it is difficult to .give a specific figure of the wide surface area necessary for its vaporization, because it can vary depending on the conditions such as materials of the vaporization area expanding means and the like, the wider the surface area is, it is more possible to promote efficient vaporization. It is extremely difficult to measure the surface area of porous substances and the surface area of fiber products, but a surface area of at least 50 cm 2 , preferably not less than 100 cm 2 , is practical. In the case of a wide surface area, the concentration of compound (I) in a space where Acarina repellence is intended can be adjusted to fall within the above-mentioned range by reducing the concentration of compound (I) contained in the agent, and in the case of a small surface area, the concentration of compound (I) in the space can be adjusted to fall within the above-mentioned range by increasing the concentration of compound (I) contained in the agent.  \\n      As a different method for achieving the object mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, a method comprising coating or spraying an agent comprising compound (I) on a vaporization area expanding means having a wide surface area can be mentioned. In this case, a vaporization area expanding means corresponds to a reservoir means for an agent comprising compound (I). As examples of such coating or spray means, a brush, a spray, direct spraying from a bottle container, dropwise addition using a dropper, spraying using a sprinkling pot and the like can be mentioned.  \\n      Coating and spraying on a vaporization area expanding means may be performed once or plural times, and coating and spraying may be appropriately combined. For plural times of coating or spraying, the interval between respective coatings and sprayings is calculated based on actual measurement of disappearance time of compound (I) or theoretical assumption thereof, and before the interval period expires or when it has expired, the coating or spraying is preferably applied. It is recommended that a use manual should be attached, which describes such manner.  \\n      As mentioned above, vaporization of compound (I) can be also accelerated by increasing the surface area of a vaporization area expanding means. Since compound (I) has a high boiling point, it is more preferable to use a vaporization enhancing means to forcibly vaporize compound (I). Thus, in another embodiment of the present invention, the aforementioned concentration is preferably achieved by forcibly vaporizing compound (I) using a vaporization enhancing means via or not via a vaporization area expanding means, which means is explained now.  \\n      Since the vaporization enhancing means is not particularly limited as long as it can forcibly vaporize compound (I), any means can be used. It may intend to vaporize compound (I) alone or it may vaporize compound (I) when vaporizing other substances contained along with compound (I) in an agent comprising compound (I).  \\n      As such means, a heating means and an air blowing means can be mentioned. For example, when a heating means is used as an enhancing means to vaporize compound (I), as one embodiment to achieve the object of the present invention, one using an apparatus equipped with a heating means (preferably further equipped with a temperature control means), which heats an agent comprising compound (I) included in the inside of the apparatus to a suitable temperature by a heating means and a temperature control means, and vaporizes compound (I) from the inner and outer surfaces and/or outer surface of the apparatus can be mentioned. In another embodiment, an apparatus is used, wherein this apparatus is combined with the aforementioned vaporization area expanding means having a wide surface area, one end of the vaporization area expanding means is immersed in a reservoir containing an agent comprising compound (I) to allow absorption by a capillary phenomenon, or the agent comprising compound (I) is continuously supplied to a vaporization area expanding means to allow absorption, and a reservoir means or a vaporization area expanding means for the agent comprising compound (I) are heated to an appropriate temperature by a heating means and a temperature control means to forcibly evaporate compound (I). As the above-mentioned heating means, heat generation by heating wires such as nichrome wire and the like, low energy light sources such as a pilot lamp, and the like can be mentioned. As the above-mentioned temperature control means, a bimetal is most convenient, but one controlling an electric power to be supplied to a heating wire by inputting a temperature detected by a thermo couple, a thermistor and the like into a CPU may be used.  \\n      When an air blowing means is used as a vaporization enhancing means, use of an apparatus that forcibly vaporizes compound (I) by blowing an air by an air blowing means against a vaporization area expanding means that has absorbed an agent comprising compound (I) can be mentioned. As such air blowing means, fans such as a propeller fan, a sirocco fan and the like, a pump having a film and a valve (e.g., a pump used for bubbling an air into a water tank when raising goldfish) and the like can be mentioned. As a different embodiment, an apparatus wherein a heating means is incorporated in pair with an air blowing means, an agent comprising compound (I) is heated to an appropriate temperature by sending a warm air to a vaporization area expanding means to forcibly vaporize compound (I) can be mentioned.  \\n      As the heating temperature of the heating means, since a flash point of compound (I) is as low as about 110\\u00b0 C. and as high as about 160\\u00b0 C., a temperature of not less than 10\\u00b0 C. lower than the flash point is preferable. This temperature needs to be appropriately adjusted in accordance with the properties of the diluent and the like to be used alongside. For example, it is 50-110\\u00b0 C., preferably 60-100\\u00b0 C. In addition, the wind speed of the air blowing means is preferably 0.001-5 m/sec, and the air quantity is preferably 0.001-10 L/sec.  \\n      It is possible to have gaseous compound (I) present at a concentration of 0.001-20,000 \\u03bcg/L in a space where Acarina repellence is intended, by regularly coating or spraying an agent comprising compound (I) on items placed in a house. As such items, for example, carpet, tatami mat, bedding, stuffed toy, floral tube, vase, decorative figurine, artificial flower, and other items generally set in a house can be mentioned. In one embodiment of the present invention, a method comprising adding an agent comprising compound (I) to a flooring wax or other polishing agents, impregnating a disposable mop, a reusable mop and the like therewith and coating a windowsill, a doorsill, a screen window and the like can be mentioned, and according to such method, invasion of Acarina can be prevented and Acarina can be forced out by evaporating compound (I) from a wide surface area and filling the vapor of compound (I) in the room or near the coated surface. An item to which an agent comprising compound (I) has been applied corresponds to a reservoir means for the agent comprising compound (I) and a vaporization area expanding means.  \\n      An agent comprising compound (I) can take any dosage form such as tablet, pellet, capsule, cream, ointment, aerosol, powder, liquid, emulsion, suspension and the like. While the agent of the present invention can be used alone, it may be used concurrently with other Acarina control agents. In addition, other components effective for Acarina control may be added to give a single preparation.  \\n      To facilitate use of the agent of the present invention, it is preferable to add, besides compound (I), a solvent, a carrier, an emulsifier, a stabilizer and the like to give a preparation and use the preparation by processing as necessary into a dilute solution and the like. Where necessary, other components, such as an antioxidant, a sustaining substance, a paint, a carrier, a flavor, a coloring agent and the like may be added or combined. It is preferable to make a flavor or a coloring agent function as an indicator informing the timing of replacing the item for controlling Acarina using the agent of the present invention. For example, a flavor having a lower boiling point than that of compound (I), which loses fragrance the item for controlling Acarina had when use was started, before disappearance of compound (I) or which clearly indicates the change of fragrance, is preferably added.  \\n      Of compounds (I), those having a double bond are gradually oxidized in the air. To prevent this, an antioxidant is preferably added or concurrently used. As the antioxidant, for example, phenol type antioxidants such as vitamin E, butylhydroxytoluene, Irganox 1010, Irganox 1076 and the like; polyphenol type antioxidants such as tannic acid, gellic acid and the like are used. The amount of use thereof is preferably in the range of 0.001-10 wt %, more preferably in the range of 0.1-5 wt %, relative to compound (I).  \\n      As an Acarina controlling ingredient that can be added besides compound (I), for example, compounds having a repellent effect against Acarina such as diethyltoluamide, 2,3,4,5-bis(\\u03942-butylene)-tatrahydrofurfural, di-n-propylisocinchomeronate di-n-butylsuccinate, 2-hydroxyethyloctylsulfide, 2-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, 3-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, 1-ethynyl-2-methyl-pentenyl 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, N-hexyl-3,4-dichloromaleimide and the like can be mentioned. An Acarina control agent containing these components can be used concurrently with the agent of the present invention.  \\n      As the above-mentioned solvent, any solvent can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I). As such solvent, for example, alcohols such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and the like; silicone oil, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, jojoba oil, squalane, liquid paraffin; rape seed oil, cotton seed oil, tung oil, camellia oil, other vegetable oils and the like can be mentioned. The amount of use thereof is preferably in the range of 10-99 wt %, more preferably in the range of 50-95 wt %, of the entire preparation.  \\n      As the above-mentioned carrier, any carrier can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I). As such carrier, for example, silica, active charcoal, porous zirconium phosphate, porous alumina, diatomaceous earth, perlite, vermiculite, zeolite, galleon earth, wood powder, wood chip and the like can be mentioned.  \\n      As the above-mentioned emulsifier, any emulsifier can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I). As such emulsifier, for example, alkylbenzenesulfonates, (x-olefinesulfonates, alkanesulfonates, tetraammonium salts having long-chain alkyl groups, aliphatic mono- or di-ethanolamide, (poly)ethylene glycol ester or ether of fatty acid, glycerin ester of mono-fatty acid, sorbitan esters of fatty acid, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, alkylphenyl polyoxyethylene ether and the like can be mentioned. The amount of use thereof is preferably in the range of 5-90 wt %, more preferably in the range of 10-50 wt %, of the entire preparation.  \\n      As the above-mentioned stabilizer, any stabilizer can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I). As such stabilizer, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, gelatin, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, macrogol, acacia, starch and the like can be mentioned.  \\n      As the above-mentioned sustaining substance, any sustaining substance can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I), and includes thermoplastic resins, waxes, gels, various microcapsules and the like.  \\n      The agent comprising compound (I) may be a solid. As a sustaining substance to be added to give a solid, for example, thermoplastic resins, waxes, gels, microcapsules, porous inorganic particles and the like can be mentioned.  \\n      The agent comprising compound (I) to be used for the method of the present invention may be a formed solid. The formed solid may take any form of granule, pellet, rod, sheet, bulk, flake, sponge and the like, and may be used as a closet dusting powder, an under floor dusting powder and the like, or as an interior decoration, such as a decorative figurine for an alcove ornament, a vase, a calendar, a tapestry, a candle and the like. In addition, a formed product can be used in a container that permits easy vaporization of compound (I) at important points in the house. By taking the form of a formed product, compound (I) can be vaporized for a longer period as compared to the use as the aforementioned liquid.  \\n      With regard to the thermoplastic resin, use of a resin having a markedly high molding temperature results in vaporization of compound (I) and the like and marked generation of white smoke upon kneading compound (I) or a dilute solution thereof during molding. Therefore, a thermoplastic resin having a molding temperature of less than 200\\u00b0 C., preferably not more than 160\\u00b0 C., more preferably not more than 140\\u00b0 C., is preferably used. In contrast, use of a resin having a markedly low molding temperature results in a limited use due to high stickiness of the resin. Thus, a resin having a molding temperature of not less than 50\\u00b0 C. is preferably used. As the preferable thermoplastic resin, for example, low melting point resins such as a soft acrylic resin comprising (meth)acrylic ester-copolymer, a soft acrylic resin prepared to have a core-shell structure consisting of a rubber part and a hard resin part, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymeric resin, a poly(trans-isoprene) resin, a thermoplastic elastomer prepared by block polymerization of styrene-butadiene or isoprene and the like, poly-e-caprolactone, poly-D,L-decalactone, polydioxinone, urethane resins and the like can be mentioned. The amount of compound (I) to be added to a thermoplastic resin is preferably determined for prolonging the effective period by experimentally setting an upper limit amount free of bleeding of compound (I) from the resin and choosing the highest possible amount within the limits. For example, when a soft acrylic resin is used as a thermoplastic resin, the amount of compound (I) to be added is preferably in the range of 10-50 wt %.  \\n      As the waxes, for example, higher alcohol, candelilla wax, rice wax, carbawax, Japan wax, yellow beeswax, microcrystalline wax, polyethylene wax, stearic acid, paraffin wax, vaseline, whale oil, beef tallow and the like can be mentioned. The amount of compound (I) to be added to these waxes is preferably determined for prolonging the effective period by experimentally setting an upper limit amount free of bleeding of compound (I) from the wax and choosing the highest possible amount within the limits. For example, when stearic acid is used as a wax, the amount of compound (I) to be added is preferably in the range of 10-60 wt %.  \\n      As the gels, one that can become an oil gel is preferable for containing a large amount of compound (I). For example, a gelling component such as sodium stearate, aluminum stearate, aluminum 2-ethylhexanoate, dibenzylidene sorbitol and the like is added to compound (I), and a small amount of alcohol or water is used to prepare a gel product. The amount of compound (I) to be added to such gel is preferably 10-60 wt %.  \\n      As the above-mentioned paint, any paint can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I). As such paint, for example, varnish; enamel; acetylcellulose lacquer; ethylcellulose lacquer; alkyd resin enamels and varnishes; vinyl resin enamels and varnishes such as vinyl chlorides, vinyl acetate-methacrylates, styrene-butadienes and the like; pigment oil paste paint, and the like can be mentioned. When compound (I) is added to these paints, an amount is preferably determined for prolonging the effective period by experimentally setting an upper limit amount free of stickiness of paint after drying and choosing the highest possible amount within the limits. When it is added to, for example, varnish, the amount of compound (I) to be added to the paint is preferably in the range of 1-10%.  \\n      As the above-mentioned flavor, any of natural flavors and synthetic flavors can be used as long as it does not exert an adverse influence on compound (I) and does not prevent the Acarina repellent effect of compound (I). When the agent of the present invention is used in the living space, use of highly safe flavor is particularly preferable. As the natural flavor, for example, bergamot oil, mentha oil, lemongrass oil, eucalyptus oil, Japanese cypress oil, citronella oil and the like can be mentioned, and as the synthetic flavor, for example, terpenoid flavors such as linalool, lynalyl acetate, geraniol, nerolidol, citral and the like can be mentioned.  \\n      The porous inorganic particles mean porous particles made from hardly soluble or insoluble inorganic powder, having an average particle size of from 1 \\u03bcm to 10 mm, more preferably from 2 \\u03bcm to 5 mm, and having a BET surface area of not less than 50 m 2 /g, more preferably not less than 100 m 2 /g.  \\n      The porous inorganic particles comprise silica; metal oxides such as alumina, zinc oxides, magnesium oxides, titanium oxides, zirconium oxides and the like; metal hydroxides such as aluminum hydroxides, magnesium hydroxides and the like; metal silicates such as calcium silicates, magnesium silicates, aluminum silicates and the like; metal carbonates such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and the like; metal sulfates such as calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate and the like; clay minerals such as montmorillonite, talc, pyrophyllite, zeolite and the like; and the like.  \\n      The porous inorganic particles may be synthesized by a sol-gel method using metal alkoxide and the like, an ion exchange method using a soluble salt of a metal and the like, or naturally occurring ones may be used as they are or after purification. When the synthesized or naturally occurring inorganic material itself is an already substantial porous solid, this porous solid may be appropriately adjusted.to an easy-to-use size by a means such as pulverization, sieving and is the like and used as a carrier to absorb compound (I). When such method is not directly available, the synthesized or naturally occurring inorganic material may be suspended in a solvent such as water and the like and granulated by a spray-dry method, or granulated to a desired particle size in a granulator that rotates a slurry or a powder while drying, and the like, adjusted in size, and where necessary, and sintered and the like to secure stability of the particles, which are then used as a carrier. As a modified method, a clay mineral having enlarged layer-to-layer spacing by a treatment with tetraammonium salts may be used as a carrier; a binder made from an organic polymer substance that improves binding of inorganic powders and compound (I) may be granulated simultaneously to introduce compound (I) at once into the inorganic carrier; and an organic polymer substance containing compound (I) as a binder may be mixed with these inorganic powders and the powder mixture can be granulated together.  \\n      The agent of the present invention can be prepared into any dosage form, such as an aerosol, an oil agent, a fumigant, a sheet, a powder, a microcapsule, a water dispersible agent and the like by a known method. The agent of the present invention in these dosage forms is applied to various materials such as woven cloth, knitted cloth, wet type non-woven fabric (paper), dry type non-woven fabric, plywood, synthetic resin sheet, synthetic resin plate, wood and the like by the operations of spraying, coating, impregnation, spreading and the like.  \\n      When compound (I), which is the active ingredient in the agent of the present invention, is added to various resins and processed into molded objects such as fiber, film, sheet, plate and the like, and these molded objects are used as starting materials for production of commodities for living in a house where Acarina inhabit, such as various building materials, tatami mat, bedding, carpet, batting and the like, and the molded objects are used as members for controlling Acarina, the aforementioned molded objects, commodities for living and various members that express an Acarina controlling effect are also encompassed in the present invention.  \\n      When a preparation is formed, the content of compound (I) in the agent of the present invention is preferably in the range of 0.1-99 wt %, more preferably in the range of 5-99 wt %. The amount of the agent of the present invention to be used is not particularly limited as long as an Acarina controlling effect is expressed, but it is, for example, preferably in the range of about 0.01-10 g, more preferably in the range of about 0.1-3 g, based on compound (I), per unit area 1 m 2  of a target object for the operation of spraying, coating, impregnation, spreading and the like.  \\n      When compound (I) is added to various resins and processed into molded objects such as fiber, film, sheet, plate and the like, moreover, the content of compound (I) in the molded object is preferably in the range of about 1-60 wt %, more preferably in.the range of about 10-50 wt %.  \\n      In addition, the agent of the present invention can be formed into microcapsules. As the microcapsule, microcapsules prepared by surface polymerization, in situ polymerization, submerged curing coating, core salvation, physical and mechanical production method or a combination of these known methods are used. As the wall materials of microcapsules, for example, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, polyurea, epoxy resin, polystyrene resin, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polylactic acid resin, acrylic resin, cellulose resin, sodium alginate, acacia, polyvinyl alcohol, gelatin, albumin and the like can be mentioned, with preference given to polylactic acid resin.  \\n      While the average particle size of the microcapsule is not particularly limited, but it is preferably in the range of 10 \\u03bcm-1 mm, more preferably in the range of 20 \\u03bcm-500 \\u03bcm. The reason therefor is that, when the particles of microcapsules are too fine, compound (I) inside is released in a short time, oxidized, and the effective period of microcapsules becomes short. On the other hand, when the particles of microcapsules are too coarse, kneading into molded objects and the like becomes difficult and the kinds of objects capable of containing the particles are limited. For example, when microcapsules are adhered to a fiber product using a binder, the microcapsules are regarded clearly as a foreign substance and artificially eliminated, or intentionally crushed to stain the fiber products.  \\n      The amount of the microcapsules used to achieve the aforementioned Acarina repellence concentration is preferably not less than 3 g, more preferably not less than 5 g, per 1 m 2  of the space where repellence is intended, such as inside a room and the like. The release of compound (I) from the microcapsules is limited to a very low level, and even if a large amount is used, no problem occurs in terms of living environment. In consideration of economical aspect, and those who are highly sensitive to smell and do not like the smell of compound (I), however, it is preferably not more than 100 g, more preferably not more than 50 g, per 1 m 2 .  \\n      By kneading the agent of the present invention with the aforementioned thermoplastic resins and then molding, a tape, a film, a sheet, a fiber, or other molded objects, having Acarina controllability, can be obtained. By processing these molded objects, closet spread materials, placement materials, clothing spreads, furniture back placement materials, under tatami mat spreads, floor sheets, carpet sheets, automobile interior materials, bed mats, mattresses, animal Acarina control bands (collars), pet animal clothings, pet animal spread and the like with Acarina controllability can be obtained. In addition, by attaching the agent of the present invention to a fiber product using a binder, a broad range of fiber products can have Acarina controllability, which may then be processed into Acarina controllable fiber products such as bedding, coverlet for kotatsu and the like. The agent of the present invention can be added to a paint, a paste agent and a spraying agent, which can be used as a paint or an adhesive for building materials, or sprayed on kennels and furnishings for pets and animals, or sprayed onto the body of an animal, whereby Acarina attached to kennels and animal bodies can be forced out.  \\n      The\\u201cAcarina\\u201d in the present invention means terrestrial animals belonging to the phylum Arthropoda, the class Arachnida, the order Acarina, and includes, for example, \\n          Acarina belonging to the family Acaridae, such as  Tyrophagus putrescentiae, Caloglyphus berlesei  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Epidermoptidae, such as  Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Cheyletidae, such as  Chelacaropsis moorei, Cheyletus malaccensis  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Glycyphagidae, such as  Glycyphagus domesticus  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Tarsonemidae, such as  Tarsonemus granarius  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Raphignathidae, such as  Raphignathus domesticus  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Macronyssidae, such as  Ornithonyssus bacoti  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Sarcoptidae, such as  Sarcoptes scabiei  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Trombiculidae, such as  Leptotrormbidium pallidum, Leptotrombidium scutellare  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Tetranychidae, such as  Tetranychus ludeni, Tetranychus urticae, Eotelranychus smithi  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Tenuipalpidae, such as  Brevipalpus lewisi  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Eriophyidae, such as  Calepitrimerus vitis, Colomerus vitis  and the like;     Acarina belonging to the family Carpoglyphidae, such as  Carpoglyphus lactis  and the like; and the like.        \\n\\n     EXAMPLES  \\n      The present invention is explained in detail by referring to the following Examples, which are not to be construed as limitative.  \\n     Reference Example 1  \\n      measurement of farnesylacetone concentration in the air  \\n      Farnesylacetone (1 mL) was placed in a 50 mL sample bottle, and a large magnetic stirring bar capable of rotating the air as well was placed therein. The bottle was placed neck-deep in an oil bath at 130\\u00b0 C. with rotation, and heated for 1 hr to saturate the inside of the sample bottle with farnesylacetone vapor. Thereafter, the gas in the sample bottle was taken by 5 mL with a gas tight syringe, and using gas chromatography with an FID detector, the concentration of farnesylacetone was measured by the absolute calibration method. As a result, 20,000 \\u03bcg/L of farnesylacetone was found to be contained in this 5 mL gas. This sampled gas somewhat contained a white mist, had a strong odor, caused cough when inhaled in a large amount, and provoked uncomfortable feeling in human.  \\n      Farnesylacetone (1 mL) was placed in a 50 mL sample bottle, and a large magnetic stirring bar capable of rotating the air as well was placed therein. The bottle was placed neck-deep in a water bath at 60\\u00b0 C. with rotation, and heated for 1 hr to fill the inside of the sample bottle with farnesylacetone vapor. Thereafter, the gas in the sample bottle was taken by 5 mL with a gas tight syringe, and using gas chromatography with an FID detector, the concentration of farnesylacetone was measured by an absolute calibration method. As a result, 20 \\u03bcg/L of farnesylacetone was found to be contained in this 5 mL gas. Almost simultaneously, the gas (5 mL) in the sample bottle was taken again, a propeller was set in a 10 L beaker, the gas was added into the sealed beaker, the air in the beaker was stirred with the propeller for 10 min to dilute the gas 2,000-fold, whereby gas containing 0.01 \\u03bcg/L farnesylacetone was obtained. The diluted gas (200 mL) was sampled with a syringe, a propeller was set in a 2 L flask, the gas was added into the sealed flask, the air in the beaker was stirred with the propeller for 10 min to further dilute the gas 10-fold, whereby gas containing 0.001 \\u03bcg/L farnesylacetone was obtained. This sampled gas scarcely had an odor detected by human.  \\n     Example 1  \\n      The \\u201cglass tube method\\u201d known as one of the repellence tests for Acarina repellent-processed fibers was modified and used for a repellence test.  \\n       FIG. 1  shows a sectional view of the apparatus for the test. As shown in  FIG. 1 , a 20 mm diameter glass tube was bent in an L shape for use, 0.5 g of absorbent cotton was packed in part B of  FIG. 1  in a 25 mm thickness, and fresh powder feed (0.1 g) for Acarina attraction, impregnated with about 20 wt % water, was placed in part C. In the L-shaped glass tube in the test section was fixed filter paper with a two-sided tape inside the glass tube at part D, a test sample (filter paper that absorbed farnesylacetone (0.1 g)) was placed, and the glass tube opening on the D side was sealed with an airtight PARAFILM. Then, a medium containing 10,000 live Acarina ( Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus ) were placed in part A of the L-shaped glass Lube, and the glass end on the A side was sealed with a high density fabric capable of preventing passage of Acarina while maintaining air permeability. This test apparatus was stood still in a container maintained at 37\\u00b11\\u00b0 C., 75\\u00b15% Rh for 48 hr. After 48 hr from the start of the test, the needle of a 5 mL gas tight syringe was pierced through the film that sealed the D side of the L-shaped test glass tube, and the inside gas (2 ml) was sampled. The farnesylacetone concentration of the gas in part D was measured by gas chromatography. The concentration was assumed to be 5 \\u03bcg/L.  \\n      Subsequently, the feed for attraction in part C was taken out, and the number of Acarina that invaded into the feed for attraction was counted by the following method. That is, the feed for attraction that was taken out was placed in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and two drops of a neutral detergent for dishes diluted to 0.5% were added dropwise, saturated brine was poured thereinto up to the mouth of the flask, and the flask was stood still for 10 min. The number of Acarina floating in the upper layer was counted. For a control section, a similar test was performed simultaneously wherein no test sample was placed in part D of the L-shaped tube. The repellence rate of the test sample was determined by the following formula and found to be 98%.\\n \\nRepellence rate (%)=(1\\u2212 number of Acarina that invaded the feed for attraction in the test section/number of Acarina that invaded the feed for attraction in the control section)\\u00d7100\\n \\n     Example 2  \\n      The invasion prevention method was modified and a repellence test was performed.  \\n       FIG. 2  shows an apparatus for the test, wherein (A) is a top view and (B) is a sectional view thereof.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 2 , a glass plate (length 13 cm, width 6 cm, thickness 1.3 mm) was used as a base (1), 2 sheets (2, 2\\u2032) of spacers made of a glass plate (length 13 cm, width 5 mm, thickness 1.3 mm) were adhered to the both long edges of the base 1 and 2 sheets (3, 3\\u2032) of spacers made of a glass plate (length 5 cm, width 5 mm, thickness 1.3 mm) were adhered to the both short edges of the base, both with an instant adhesive to give a test box (shallow box of length 12 cm, width 5 cm, depth 1.3 mm). As a lid to cover this box (4, 4\\u2032), two glass plates (length 5.5 cm, width 6 cm, thickness 1.3 mm) were prepared.  \\n      An ethanol solution of farnesylacetone (1%, 100 mg) was coated on the surface of one (test section side) of the two lids to cover the test box, and ethanol was air dried for 10 min. Then, a sample for Acarina attraction (50 mg) each was placed on both ends of the test box in the longitudinal direction, and the above-mentioned farnesylacetone-coated lid (4\\u2032) alone was placed, such that the surface coated with farnesylacetone faced the inside of the box. The box was placed in an incubator at 37\\u00b0 C. for 60 min until the farnesylacetone vapor filled the test section side of the test box. The other lid was placed thereon, such that the center of the test box had a 2 cm gap, through which 50,000  Dermatophagoides farinae  were released, and the test box was placed in an incubator maintained at 25\\u00b0 C. for 1 day. Thereafter, the test container was taken out, the number of Acarina that invaded into the feeds in the test section side and the control section side (50 and 1100, respectively, the rest of the Acarina fled) was counted. The repellence rate was determined by the following formula and found to be 95%. The concentration of farnesylacetone filled in the air at 37\\u00b0 C. was measured in the same manner as in Reference Example 1 and assumed to be 5 \\u03bcg/L.\\n \\nRepellence rate (%)=(1\\u2212 number of Acarina that invaded the test section/number of Acarina that invaded the control section)\\u00d7100\\n \\n      Under these test conditions, farnesylacetone was not coated on the floor of the test box, which means that Acarina avoided the farnesylacetone vapor present in the space of the passage at a sufficient height where the body of Acarina could avoid physical contact.  \\n     Example 3  \\n      A 2L flask containing the gas containing 0.001 \\u03bcg/L farnesylacetone prepared in the same manner as in Reference Example 1 was equipped with a Teflon\\u00ae tube (inner diameter 2 mm) for discharging the gas containing farnesylacetone and a Teflon\\u00ae tube for charging water into the container using a metering pump, whereby an apparatus to send out (supply) the gas containing farnesylacetone at 1 mL/min by introducing water into the flask at 1 mL/min was manufactured. The test apparatus made of the glass plates used in Example 2 was modified by setting an injection needle for charging the gas containing farnesylacetone at the deepest part of the test section side and connecting the injection needle to a Teflon\\u00ae tube from the apparatus for supplying the above-mentioned gas containing farnesylacetone. In addition, an injection needle for charging the air free of farnesylacetone was set at the deepest part of the control section side and fresh air was introduced at 1 mL/min.  \\n      Then the test apparatus was placed in a room with constant temperature and humidity at 37\\u00b11\\u00b0 C., 75\\u00b15% Rh, and the apparatus was operated for 3 hr for filling the test section with the above-mentioned concentration of farnesylacetone, after which an Acarina medium containing 10000 live Acarina were inserted from the gap of the lid and left standing for 4 hr. Then, the number of Acarina that invaded into the feed for attraction in each part C of the test section side and the control section side was counted. That is, the feed for attraction was taken out and placed in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and two drops of a neutral detergent for dishes diluted to 0.5% were added dropwise, saturated brine was poured thereinto up to the mouth of the flask, and the flask was stood still for 10 min. The number of Acarina floating in the upper layer was counted.

The wax containing farnesylacetone was adhered around a lampwick, whereby a candle for a votive candle of Buddhist altar was made experimentally. The dust obtained by sweeping a room, in which a votive candle (heating means) was lit every day, with an electric vacuum cleaner was observed with a microscope. As a result, Acarina were not found in the dust obtained from the room in which a votive candle was lit, but the dust obtained by sweeping other rooms contained 10 Acarina in 0.5 g thereof. The gaseous farnesylacetone concentration was 60 \\u03bcg/L in the room after the votive candle went out.  \\n     Example 5  \\n      Farnesylacetone (10 g) was mixed with a soft acrylic resin powder (100 g, product name Parapet SA-N, manufactured by KURARAY CO. LTD.) and blended at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was melt kneaded in a twin roll kneader at 125\\u00b0 C. for 1 min and press molded at 135\\u00b0 C., 50 kg/cm 2  for 1 min to give a 1 mm thick soft rubber sheet (reservoir means and vaporization area expanding means). This sheet was placed under a part of a carpet, and after living normally for 2 weeks, the dust obtained from the part above the sheet containing farnesylacetone with an electric vacuum cleaner and the dust obtained from a part far from the sheet containing farnesylacetone were compared by microscopic observation. As a result, Acarina were not found in the dust obtained from the part above the sheet containing farnesylacetone, but the dust obtained from the part far from the sheet contained 7 Acarina in 0.5 g thereof. The air in the carpet where the soft acrylic sheet was placed was driven out and the farnesylacetone concentration was measured and found to be 1 \\u03bcg/L.  \\n     Example 6  \\n      A dispersion phase obtained by dissolving farnesylacetone (2 g) and polyacetate (10 g, manufactured by Cargill Dow LLC, number average molecular weight 87,000, weight average molecular weight 163,300, D/L ratio 8/92) in dichloromethane (100 mL) and a continuous phase consisting of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution (1400 mL) and a surfactant (Q12S) (10.4 g) were mixed, stirred at a rate of 100 rpm with a propeller stirrer at 30\\u00b0 C. for 30 min. The level of reduced pressure in the reaction vessel was raised stepwisely, and the mixture was stirred for 6 hr under reduced pressure created by an aspirator to evaporate dichloromethane. The obtained suspension was passed through a glass filter, the resultant was washed with water several times, and lyophilized for one day to give a microcapsule including farnesylacetone. The obtained microcapsule was an about spherical particle having an average particle size of 0.4 mm and showed dry flowability similar to the grain of sand.  \\n     Example 7  \\n      The  Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus  repellence rate of the microcapsule obtained in Example 6 was determined by the repellence test method (invasion preventive method: see Experimental Example 1) and found to be 99%. According to this method, a repellence rate of 60% or above is considered to be effective. In addition, the microcapsule obtained in Example 6 was placed in a container without a lid and left standing at room temperature for 2 months or 6 months and a similar test was performed. As a result, the repellence rate was 99% 2 months later and 81% 6 months later, demonstrating retention of the effect for a very long period.  \\n     Example 8  \\n      The microcapsule (30 g) obtained in Example 6 was mixed with a soft acrylic resin powder (100 g, product name Parapet SA-N, manufactured by KURARAY CO.

The microcapsules were uniformly dispersed in the sheet but abnormality such as smoke and the like was not found during the molding process.  \\n     Example 9  \\n      To a slurry (600 g) having a solid content of 17%, which was obtained by diluting monodispersed silica particles having an average particles size of 0.045 \\u03bcm (manufactured by Nissan Chemical Industries Ltd., Snowtex OL) with water was added water (20 g) dissolving polyvinyl alcohol (2 g, PVA 117 manufactured by KURARAY CO. LTD.) as a binder and the mixture was thoroughly mixed. The obtained slurry was spray-dried with a spray dryer (L-8, manufactured by Ohkawarakakouki Co., Ltd.) to give agglomerated particles having a particles size of about 20 \\u03bcm. The particles were sintered at 450\\u00b0 C. for 1 hr to remove the binder, whereby porous agglomerated particles (95 g) consisting of silica were obtained. A solution of phytone (20 g) and ethanol (80 mL) was placed in a pear-shaped flask, and the above-mentioned porous agglomerate (80 g) was added. The pear-shaped flask was set on a rotary evaporator and rotated for 5 min at normal pressure. While gradually raising the level of reduced pressure and temperature, ethanol was removed by evaporation to give sand-like silica particles retaining phytone.  \\n     Example 10  \\n      Polyvinyl acetate (5 g) and farnesylacetone (10 g) were dissolved in methanol (300 mL) and porous silica powder (100 g) was added to the solution.

No. 2,136,690 discloses a multi-piece solid-stem valve, in which the valve seat has a reinforced lining of a wear-resistant material. The reinforced lining comprises a prefabricated, centrally perforated disk composed of a resistant and thermally conductive composite material which is conically beveled at the outer edge, said reinforced lining disk extending to the edge of the valve head and forming the head-side sealing face. The composite material is formed from a matrix composed of tough, conductive metal, preferably containing copper, into which finely dispersed particles of a hard, resistant material such as tungsten are firmly embedded. These hard particles are intended not only to protect the matrix but also to prevent or at least delay destruction of the valve sealing faces. In the known valve the disk serving as reinforced lining is riveted on to the head-side end of the valve stem together with a backing disk of conventional valve material applied to the combustion chamber side, the stem material serving as rivet. Here therefore, the valve head itself is of multi-piece construction, comprising two disks. A relatively wide shoulder is forged on the valve stem in order to axially support the valve head, comprising reinforced lining disk and backing disk, and prevent it from tilting. With a pin serving as rivet shank, the head-side end of the valve stem projects through the center opening of the two disks, the outer end of this pin being deformed into a rivet head extending in a spot-facing of the backing disk opening. Although the valve head is connected to the valve stem by a positively interlocking connection acting in both directions of the axial force\\u2014tensile and compressive\\u2014a disadvantage of the known valve is that in order to guide the disk connection of the multi-piece valve head and prevent it from tilting, a relative wide radial shoulder has to be formed on to the valve stem, the radial width of which shoulder in the example of an embodiment represented by the prior art is equal to approximately one third of the stem diameter. The shoulder formed by upsetting assumes not only the function of an axial support designed to prevent tilting of the multi-layered valve head, but also, by virtue of the smooth transition from the stem cross-section to the shoulder circumference, the function of a flow baffle element on the upper side of the valve head around which the flow passes. Another disadvantage is that the high-frequency impact stresses can result in minute relative displacements between the connected parts in the direction of rotation, which can lead to wear at the contact faces and hence to a loosening of the connection.  \\n      The earlier patent application by the present applicant, DE 100 29 299 A1, not previously published, not only describes different design constructions for multi-piece valves of the type addressed here but also goes into the methods of manufacturing the types of valve presented. However, for production reasons all of the valves disclosed are provided with a hollow stem, which although advantageous in the case of the present invention is in no way an essential prerequisite. Advantages of the known valve are the low weight and/or the long service life of the valve, which ensue from the fact that lightweight materials, in particular ceramic and titanium aluminide, capable of withstanding high thermal and/or tribological stresses can be used for the valve head. One disadvantage of the known valve, however, is that possible differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion, which depending on the mating of materials can sometimes be considerable, can result at the operating temperature of the multi-piece valve in a relaxation of the pre-tensioning in the connection between valve stem and valve head. Under the stresses occurring in operation this could likewise lead to a relative shifting of the contact surfaces and consequently to contact wear and loosening of the connection.  \\n      For the sake of completeness, reference should also be made to EP 296 619 A1, which likewise shows a multi-piece valve, the structural components of which are composed of different materials. The tubular valve stem is preferably composed of chromium molybdenum steel. The valve head, which should preferably be composed of a titanium aluminide intermetallic material, can be produced by precision casting. The finished valve head is provided on the upper side with a blind hole to receive the head-side stem end. The valve stem can be fixed in the blind hole by shrink fitting, cold pressing, brazing or by a combination of these joining techniques. In one case shown in the drawing of this specification, the inner surface of the blind hole is moreover formed with an axial corrugation, the end wall of the stem tube being expanded under the effect of pressure and localized heating and at the same time being designed to positively interlock in the corrugations on the hole side. In the case of the multi-piece hollow-stem valve according to EP 296 619 A1, however, there is reason to doubt whether the connection between valve stem and valve head will be sufficiently durable under the considerable static and dynamic loads imposed by both the thermal and the mechanical stresses.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The object of the invention is to improve upon the above-described valves so as to improve the service life of the connection between valve head and valve stem.  \\n      According to the invention this object is achieved in a valve that includes a valve stem and a valve head. The valve stem includes a head-side end and a flange. The valve head includes a combustion chamber-side, a center through-opening extending to the combustion chamber-side, and an annular bearing surface. The center through-opening has a larger section at the combustion chamber-side. The valve stem extends into the center through-opening of the valve head. The flange of the valve stem bears against the annular bearing surface of the valve head to limit the insertion depth of the valve stem into the center through-opening of the valve head. The head-side end of the valve stem is expanded in the larger section of the center through-opening. The larger section of the center through-opening and the expanded head-side end of the valve stem deviate from a rotationally symmetrical shape to form a positive torsional interlock connection between the valve stem and the valve head.  \\n      The torsionally fixed design of the connection between valve head and valve stem effectively prevents any relative movement of the connected parts. Creep movements and resulting wear in the joint are therefore avoided. The joint is thereby better able to withstand the thermal and mechanical stresses constantly occurring in engine operation.  \\n      Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.  \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  shows a perspective detailed representation of a valve head looking towards the combustion chamber side and the non-circular enlargement of the center opening.  \\n       FIG. 2  shows a valve assembled using a valve head according to  FIG. 1 .  \\n       FIGS. 3 and 4  show two further examples of embodiments of valve heads and non-circular enlargements of the center opening.  \\n       FIG. 5  shows two different variants of a further example of an embodiment of a multi-piece valve with hollow stem and separate tensile expansion section in the connection between valve head and valve stem. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      The invention, which for the moment will be explained below in general terms in connection with the various embodiments, proceeds from a multi-piece valve  1 ,  1 \\u2032,  1 \\u2033 for reciprocating piston engines. The valve includes a valve stem  2 ,  2 \\u2032,  2 \\u2033 and a structurally separate valve head  3 ,  3 \\u2032,  3 \\u2033,  3 \\u2032\\u2033, which is connected to the valve stem  2  by a positively interlocking connection acting in both the tensile and compressive directions. For this purpose the single-piece valve head  3 ,  3 \\u2032,  3 \\u2033,  3 \\u2032\\u2033 is provided with a center through-opening  4 ,  4 \\u2032 to receive the head-side end of the valve stem, the edge of which opening situated on the combustion chamber side  10  of the valve head  3  is conically enlarged, thus forming an enlargement  6 ,  6 \\u2032,  6 \\u2033. For its part the valve stem  2  on the outer circumference has a flange  7 ,  7 \\u2032 perpendicular to the axis and defining the insertion depth of the valve stem into the center opening, and an annular bearing surface  5 ,  5 \\u2032 is being provided in the area of the center opening  4  of the valve head  3  for the stem-side flange  7  to bear against. After fitting the head and stem together, the combustion chamber-side or head-side end  13 ,  13 \\u2032 of the valve stem is plastically expanded in the area of the combustion chamber-side enlargement  6  of the center opening, filling the center opening and forming a positive interlock, so that a heading  8 ,  8 \\u2032 is produced. The heading  8 ,  8 \\u2032, together with the pair of bearing surfaces, forms a positively interlocking connection between the head and the stem in the tensile direction and in the compressive direction. Considering that the valve head is domed on its upper side so as to assist the flow and therefore has a certain overall height, so that it can function as a flow baffle element, the pair of axial bearing surfaces  5  and  7  only needs to be narrow in a radial direction. Tilt-free guidance of the valve head in relation to the valve stem is achieved through the overall height of the valve head and the correspondingly large insertion depth of the stem in the valve head.  \\n      In order to be able to improve the service life of the connection between the valve head and the valve stem, according to the invention the combustion chamber-side enlargement  6 ,  6 \\u2032,  6 \\u2033,  6  of the center opening  4 ,  4 \\u2032 and accordingly also the conformed, end-side expansion  8 ,  8 \\u2032 of the valve stem  2 ,  2 \\u2032,  2 \\u2033 are designed to deviate from a rotationally symmetrical shape in such a way that a positively interlocking, torsionally fixed connection is formed between the valve stem  2 ,  2 \\u2032 and  2 \\u2033 and the single-piece valve head  3 ,  3 \\u2032,  3 \\u2033,  3 \\u2032\\u2033.  \\n      The torsional fixing between the valve head and the valve stem effectively prevents any relative movement of the connected parts during engine operation, and wear in the joint due to creep movements is therefore avoided. The joint is thereby better able to withstand the thermal and mechanical stresses constantly occurring in engine operation. The torsional fixing can be produced at no additional manufacturing cost.  \\n      In the example of an embodiment shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2  the combustion chamber-side enlargement  6  of the center opening  4  is conical in the manner of a truncated pyramid with rounded edges between the flat sides. The valve head  3 \\u2032\\u2033 according to  FIG. 5  would suppose an enlargement identical in shape to that shown in  FIG. 1 , although the valve head  3  according to  FIG. 5  in other features differs from the valve head  3  according to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , which will be explored in further detail below.  \\n      In the valve head  3 \\u2032 according to  FIG. 3  the combustion chamber-side enlargement  6 \\u2032 is also substantially conical in design, and a cone of pronounced oval shape is superimposed on a circular cone coaxial with the center opening. The two overlapping types of cone merge into one another, and are strongly rounded in the area of the mutual overlaps. The valve head  3 \\u2033 shown in  FIG. 4  only has one conical enlargement  6 \\u2033 of pronounced oval shape.  \\n      All three embodiments of enlargements  6 ,  6 \\u2032,  6 \\u2033 shown are of a pronounced non-circular shape, but by virtue of the gentle transitions and/or deviations from a rotational shape can be completely filled, true to shape, by a heading  8 ,  8 \\u2032 plastically formed into the enlargement. Both characteristics are important for an effective positive interlock preventing relative torsion. The smooth transitions and/or deviations from a rotational shape are also advantageous in producing such enlargements  6 ,  6 \\u2032,  6 \\u2033, whether these are produced by a forming tool\\u2014forging, casting, sintering\\u2014or by a chip-forming non-circular turning process. Manufacturing the non-circular enlargements  6  does not require any additional cost compared to the manufacture of rotationally symmetrical spot-facings, especially where the enlargements are produced by a forming tool which forms the valve head.  \\n      The embodiment of a valve  1  shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2  has a solid valve stem  1 , in which the stem-side flange  7  is machined out, for example, by a chip-forming turning process. The flange  7  is radially relatively narrow and only needs to absorb the axial pre-stressing of the connection. The radial width b of the stem-side flange  7  and the head-side bearing surface  5  is no more than about 25%, preferably approximately 15 to 20% of the stem diameter D. The valve head  3  is reliably prevented from tilting in relation to the stem  2  by the relatively large overall height of the head and the correspondingly large insertion depth of the stem. The insertion depth is significantly greater than the diameter of the stem in this area.  \\n      From the point of view of weight, even a solid valve stem, that is to say one with a solid cross-section, is still perfectly feasible in a multi-piece valve where a lightweight material is used for the valve head. The weight saving compared to a conventional valve then lies exclusively in the reduced weight of the valve head. In this context the following materials should be mentioned as feasible lightweight materials for the valve head:  \\n      a ceramic, in particular silicon carbide (SiC),  \\n      an intermetallic phase, in particular titanium aluminide,  \\n      a titanium-aluminum alloy.  \\n      In addition to the weight advantage, these materials also possess outstanding thermal and mechanical characteristics, which make them particularly desirable as valve material. Widespread use of these materials, however, has hitherto always foundered on the justifiable costs of processing and/or the question of a reliable and durable joining technique between the valve stem and the valve head.  \\n      In order to further reduce the weight of the valve, the stem made from a valve steel may be of hollow design, as is shown by the example of the valve  1 \\u2032 and  1 \\u2033 according to  FIG. 5 . The end-side walls of the hollow stem are sealed gas-tight, which can be very efficiently achieved by a continuous rolling process. Such a hollow stem may also be partially filled with a coolant, such as sodium, so that the operating temperature level of the valve can be reduced. After insertion of the head-side, as yet unheaded stem end  13  into the center opening  4 \\u2032 until the annular bearing surfaces  5 \\u2032 and  7 \\u2032 are in contact with one another, the projecting end of the valve stem is upset into the non-circular enlargement  6 , so that a countersunk head-shaped heading  8 \\u2032 is produced. This heading process can be performed in the hot state, for example also by the aforementioned continuous rolling process. At the same time the combustion chamber-side enlargement  6  of the center opening  4 \\u2032 is also filled by the upset head  8 \\u2032 forming a positive interlock, so that an effective torsional fixing is produced between the valve head  3  and the valve stem  2 \\u2032 or  2 \\u2033.  \\n      Some of the possible lightweight materials, in particular ceramics, differ quite distinctly from steel in their thermal expansion properties, that is to say they expand substantially less than steel in the event of a temperature increase. In order to nevertheless prevent the connected parts in such a mating of materials coming loose under the effects of heat, in the embodiment represented in  FIG. 5  the flange  7 \\u2032, fitted to the outside of the valve stem  2 \\u2032,  2 \\u2033 perpendicular to the axis and defining the insertion depth, is formed by a tight-fitting push-on, tubular sleeve  11  of a specific length L. The tubular sleeve is immovably fixed by its end remote from the head in a predefined axial position on the valve stem  2 \\u2032,  2 \\u2033. In the variant shown on the left in  FIG. 5  the tubular sleeve rests on a flange  12 \\u2032 of the stem  2 \\u2032, whereas in the variant shown on the right the end of the tubular sleeve remote from the head is joined to the stem  2 \\u2033 by means of a circular weld  12 . The end of the tubular sleeve  11  facing the valve head  3  in both cases forms the stem-side flange  7 \\u2032. The unilateral fixing  12 ,  12 \\u2032 of the sleeve  11  to the valve stem tube remote from the head means that the axially opposing flange  7 \\u2032 is free to move axially in relation to the valve stem tube within the limits of the elasticity of the material, this elastically defined displacement increasing in direct proportion to the length L of the sleeve.  \\n      Furthermore, in an embodiment shown in  FIG. 5  the bearing surface  5 \\u2032 fitted in the area of the center opening  4 \\u2032 of the valve head  3  and corresponding to the stem-side flange  7 \\u2032 is axially shifted inside the center opening  4 \\u2032. This results in a grip  1  significantly smaller than the axial height of the valve head  3 , or the length L of the sleeve  11 .  \\n      After tightly pushing the valve head  3  on to the end of the valve stem  2 \\u2032,  2 \\u2033, the heading  8 \\u2032 is formed into the enlargement  6  and the positively interlocking connection is made between the valve stem and the valve head. Where the valve head is formed from a material having a significantly lower coefficient of thermal expansion than steel it is important in the process of joining head and stem that the positively interlocking connection be under the greatest possible axial pre-tensioning at the room temperature of the valve. Only by virtue of a high axial pre-tensioning of the joint and the special design of the elastically displaceable flange  7 \\u2032 with pre-tensioning force reserve margin is it possible to ensure that the valve head  3 , composed of ceramic, for example, will still remain firmly clamped to the valve stem with a certain residual pre-tensioning even at the operating temperature of the valve. The greater the ratio of sleeve length L to grip  1 , the greater the pre-tensioning reserve margin of the connection. It may therefore be quite expedient to extend the sleeve  11  over virtually the entire length of the valve stem.  \\n      In order to be able to guarantee the highest possible axial pre-tensioning of the positively interlocking connection, the sleeve  11  and the valve head should be as cold as possible whilst producing the heading  8 \\u2032 and as hot as possible whilst producing that part of the valve stem tube extending inside the sleeve. A temperature equalization between the parts should be allowed to come about only once the heading  8 \\u2032 has cooled and can no longer be plastically deformed. The delayed equalization of such an enforced temperature difference causes an axial pre-tensioning to build up. Considering the high operating temperatures of exhaust valves, in particular, the aim should be for the highest possible degree of pre-tensioning at room temperature, since this pre-tensioning diminishes as the operating temperature increases. Ideally the joint pre-tensioning at room temperature should be close to the limit of elasticity of the steel material.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005078252-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A thin film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, its array substrate, and its manufacturing method.

In these digital video or image devices, display devices are important components that allow users to obtain information or to further control the operation of the video or image devices.  \\n      The sizes of video or image devices have become thinner and lighter. While traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) displays have certain advantages, they take up considerable space and consume more energy. Using optoelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing technologies, flat panel displays, such as thin film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal displays (LCDs), have become popular display products. TFT LCDs have several advantages over traditional CRT displays, such as lower operation voltage, zero radiation, light weight, and smaller volume. TFT LCDs and other flat panel displays, such as plasma displays and electroluminance displays, recently have become a main topic of display researches, and have been viewed as the mainstream display devices of the twenty-first century.  \\n       FIG. 1  shows a conventional TFT LCD panel, which typically has a TFT array substrate  102 , an opposite substrate  104 , and a liquid crystal layer (not shown), which is positioned between the substrates  102  and  104 . On the TFT array substrate  102 , there is a TFT array  112 , which includes scan lines, data lines, and thin film transistors. Between the substrates  102  and  104 , there is a frame sealant  106  that is used to seal the space between the substrates  102  and  104  so that the liquid crystal remains within the sealed space. The sealed space is mainly used to display patterns or colors, and thus is referred to as the display area. The frame sealant  106  has a liquid crystal injection hole  108  to facilitate injection of the liquid crystal.  \\n      In addition to the conventional TFT LCD panel described above, there is another kind of technique for manufacturing TFT LCD panels, characterized in that color filters (which are thin films) are fabricated directly on the substrate  102  that has the TFT array  112 . An advantage of this technique is that the aperture ratio can be increased. The TFT LCD panels that have color filters integrated on the TFT array substrate can be used in products such as thin and light-weight notebooks having high definition displays, LCD televisions, and high-end LCD monitors.  \\n      The conventional TFT LCD panel having color filters integrated with the TFT array substrate can have a number of disadvantages.  \\n      In the example of  FIG. 1 , prior to fabricating the color filters directly on the substrate  104  that has the TFT array  112 , it is necessary to fabricate the black matrix (BM) first. Many researches have focused on finding ways to reduce the cost and manufacturing time of TFT LCD panels that use the color-filter-on-array technique. When the black matrix and the color filters are fabricated on different substrates, misalignment of the back matrix and the color filters may reduce the product yield rate.  \\n      Light emitted by circuitry on the substrate  102  can be leaked from the border  110  ( FIG. 1 ) of the display area, adversely affecting the display quality of the TFT LCD panel. Light can also be leaked from the liquid crystal injection hole  108 .  \\n      Each TFT in the TFT array  112 , or the conducting lines surrounding the TFT array  112 , typically has a repair structure (not shown) that can be used to repair defects in the TFT or defects in the signal lines (line defects). In a conventional design, the repair structure is covered by a thick layer of dielectric. Bursts often occur in the dielectric layer during the repair process, preventing the defective TFT or signal line from being repaired.  \\n      Each TFT in the TFT array  112  corresponds to a storage capacitor (Cst) that is formed by an insulation layer sandwiched between two metal layers. The upper metal layer is connected to a pixel electrode so that it can be controlled by the TFT. Because of imperfections in the microlithography process, such as imperfections in the development of photoresist or etching process, portions of the dielectric layer may remain between the metal layer and the pixel electrode due to incomplete exposure or incomplete etching, resulting in poor electric contact between the metal layer and the pixel electrode. Such imperfections prevent the storage capacitor from maintaining a specified charge within a specified time to allow the display pixel to show a specified gray level, thus reducing the performance of the display panel.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      An object of the invention is to provide a TFT LCD panel and its fabrication method to reduce the fabrication time.  \\n      Another object of the invention is to provide a TFT LCD panel and its fabrication method to reduce the fabrication cost.  \\n      Another object of the invention is to provide a TFT LCD panel and its fabrication method to reduce the amount of light that is leaked at the border of the display area.  \\n      Another object of the invention is to provide a TFT LCD panel and its fabrication method to reduce the amount of light leaked at the LCD injection hole.  \\n      Another object of the invention is to provide a TFT LCD panel and its fabrication method to prevent dielectric layer bursts from occurring at the repair structures during repair processes.  \\n      Another object of the invention is to provide a TFT LCD panel and its fabrication method to prevent the problem of poor electric connectivity at the storage capacitor.  \\n      This invention provides a TFT array substrate that includes a substrate, scan lines, data lines, TFTs, pixel electrodes, color filters, and color filter stacks.

Fabrication of a black matrix can be omitted. The following embodiments are used as examples to describe the various applications of the present invention.  \\n     THE FIRST EMBODIMENT  \\n       FIG. 2  shows a schematic diagram of a TFT LCD panel according to the present invention.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 2 , a TFT LCD panel  200  according to the present invention includes a TFT array substrate  202 , an opposite substrate  204 , and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) that is positioned between the substrates  202  and  204 . On the TFT array substrate  202 , there are scan lines  210 , data lines  212 , thin film transistors  216 , pixel electrodes  218 , color filters (not referenced with labels), and color filter stacks  220 . The data lines  212  and the scan lines  210  define pixel regions  214 . Thin film transistors  216  are disposed at the intersections of data lines  212  and scan lines  210 , and are controlled by using the data lines  212  and the scan lines  210 . Pixel electrodes  218  are disposed in the pixel regions  214  and are connected to corresponding thin film transistors  216 .  \\n      The color filters (not shown) are disposed above the pixel region  214 , in which the color filters include red filters, green filters, and blue filters (the filters are in the form of thin films). The color filter stacks  220  are disposed on the color filters above the TFT  216 . When the color filter is of a first color, the color filter stack  220  can be, for example, overlapping color filters of a second color and a third color, or can be a single color filter of the second color, or a single color filter of the third color. When the color filter stack  220  is formed by overlapping color filters of the second and third colors, the color filter that is closer to the TFT  216  is thicker than the color filter that is farther away from the TFT  216 .  \\n      Because the blue filter has a higher absorption rate than the red and green filters, when only one color filter is used, it would be better to use a blue filter.  FIGS. 3A  to  3 D show the fabrication process for the present embodiment.  \\n       FIGS. 3A  to  3 D depict cross-sectional process views showing a method of fabricating a TFT array substrate according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to  FIGS. 2 and 3 A, a first metal layer is formed on the substrate  202 . The first metal layer is patterned to form gate electrodes  302  and scan lines  210  ( FIG. 2 ). A gate insulation layer  304  and an amorphous silicon layer are formed above the substrate  202 . The portions of the amorphous silicon layer that is not directly above the gate electrode are removed, forming channel layers  306  (there is one channel layer, the plural term \\u201cchannel layers\\u201d refers to multiple portions of the channel layer). A second metal layer is formed above the substrate  202 . The second metal layer is patterned to form source electrodes and drain electrodes  308  above the gate electrodes  302 , and to form data lines  212  ( FIG. 2 ) above the substrate  300 . The data lines and the scan lines define pixel regions  214  ( FIG. 2 ). The gate electrodes  302 , the channel layers  306 , the source electrodes, and the drain electrodes  308  in combination form thin film transistors  216 .  \\n      Referring to  FIGS. 2 and 3 B, a passivation layer  312  is formed above the thin film transistor  216 . A first color filter  314  is formed in the pixel region  214  (hereafter, the term \\u201cfirst color filter\\u201d refers to a color filter that allows a first color to pass). A color filter stack  220  is formed above the first color filter  314 , which is above the TFT  216 . The color filter stack  220  includes a second color filter  316  and a third color filter  318  (hereafter, the terms \\u201csecond color filter\\u201d and \\u201cthird color filter\\u201d refer to color filters that allow a second color and a third color, respectively, to pass). The color filter  314  shown at the right portion of  FIG. 3B  is part of the color filter for the pixel that includes the TFT  216 . The second color filter  316  shown at the left portion of  FIG. 3B  is part of the color filter for another pixel. Portions of the adjacent color filters  314  and  316  overlap at the data line  212  and the scan line  210 .  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 3C , a dielectric layer  322  is formed above the substrate  202  and covers the entire substrate  202 . As an example, the dielectric layer  322  can be made of acrylic acid. A pixel electrode  218  is formed above the dielectric layer  322  and is electrically connected to the drain electrode  308  of the thin film transistor  216 .  \\n       FIG. 3D  shows a cross-sectional view of the TFT LCD display panel that includes an opposite substrate  204 , which is spaced apart from the TFT array substrate  202  ( FIG. 3C ). The opposite substrate  204  includes a common electrode  222 . A liquid crystal layer  340  is formed between the opposite substrate  204  and the TFT array substrate  202 . Prior to forming the liquid crystal layer  340 , a photo spacer  326  can be formed above the dielectric layer  322  to maintain a predefined cell gap. An orientation layer (not shown) can be positioned between the TFT array substrate  202  and the liquid crystal layer  340 . Another orientation layer (not shown) can be positioned between the opposite substrate  204  and the liquid crystal layer  340 . In addition, a polarizer (not shown) can be disposed at each of the outer surface of the TFT array substrate  202  and the outer surface of the upper substrate  204 .  \\n       FIGS. 3D and 4  depicts the structure of the current embodiment.  FIG. 4  shows a top view of the TFT array substrate according to the first embodiment of the invention.  \\n      Referring to  FIGS. 3D and 4 , a color filter stack  220  according to the present invention is positioned above the TFT  216 , in which the second and third color filters  316  and  318  are stacked one over the other above the first color filter  314 . The first color filter  314  is the color filter for the pixel region  214  ( FIG. 2 ), and has an opening  400  to expose the pixel electrode  218  and the electrical contact portion of the drain electrode  308  of the TFT  216 . A second or third color filter  316  or  318  covers another side of the pixel structure, and its borders can overlap the first color filter  314 . The second or third color filter  316  or  318  can be the color filter of another pixel region.  \\n     THE SECOND EMBODIMENT  \\n      This embodiment improves the border of the display area of the TFT LCD panel. Referring to  FIG. 2 , a display area  500  refers to the region that includes pixel regions  214  and can display patterns and colors. The regions outside of the display area  500  are referred to as the non-display area.  \\n       FIGS. 5A  to  5 C depict cross-sectional process views showing a method of fabricating a TFT LCD panel according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The differences between the first and second embodiments are as follows.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 5A , the first metal layer is formed above the substrate  202 . The first metal layer is patterned to generate the structure shown in  FIG. 3A  and a first metal layer  502  at the border of the display area  500 . A gate insulation layer  304  is formed above the substrate  202 , and is used for insulation. A second metal layer is formed above the substrate. The second metal layer is patterned to form the structure shown in  FIG. 3A  and another metal layer  506  at the border of the display area  500 . The metal layers  502  and  506  are adjacent to each other, preferably partially overlapping each other (as shown in  FIG. 5D ) to prevent light from leaking at the border of the display area  500 .  \\n      When the metal layer  502  is used for external connection lines, the metal layer  502  is connected to scan line  210 , and the metal layer  506  acts as a \\u201cquasi-metal layer\\u201d for forming dummy lines. Conversely, when the metal layer  506  is used for external connection lines, the metal layer  506  is connected to the data line  212 , and the metal layer  502  serves as a quasi-metal layer. Metal layers  502  and  506  can simultaneously act as quasi-metal layers and not connect to the scan line  210  or the data line  212 . By positioning the metal layers  502  and  506  adjacent to each other, or partially overlapping each other (as shown in  FIG. 5D ), light directed towards the non-display area can be shielded, preventing light leakage.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 5B , a passivation layer  312  is formed above the substrate  202 . Optionally, at least one color filter can be formed above the substrate at the border of the display area  500  to enhance the light shielding effect. In the example shown in  FIG. 5B , a color filter stack  220  is formed above a first color filter  314  above the TFT  216  ( FIG. 2 ). The color filter stack  220  can also be a single layer of the second color filter or the third color filter.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 5C , a dielectric layer  322  is formed above the substrate  202 , covering the color filter stack  220 . A frame sealant  522 , such as a frame sealant that has ball spacers, is formed on the substrate  202 . The opposite substrate  204  is provided and glued to the TFT array substrate.  \\n      Please note that in the present embodiment, although the color filter stack  220  and the adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506  are formed above the substrate  202 , as shown in  FIGS. 5A and 5D , all that is required is to form a structure that can shield light at the border of the display area  500  of the TFT array substrate. In one example, during the fabrication process described above, the fabrication of the color filter stack  220  can be omitted, and only the adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506  are formed. In another example, the adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506  are omitted, and only the color filter stack  220  is formed.  \\n       FIGS. 5C and 6  depict the structure of the present embodiment.  FIG. 6  shows a top view of the border of the display area of the TFT LCD panel according to the second embodiment.  \\n      Referring to  FIGS. 5C and 6 , the color filter stack  220  of the present embodiment is positioned at the border of the display area  500 , and the metal layers  502  and  506  are positioned between the color filter stack  220  and the substrate  202 . The metal layers  502  and  506  are electrically insulated from each other, and are adjacent to or partially overlap each other to prevent light leakage. The structure according to the present embodiment can be chosen to have only one color filter stack  220  at the border of the display area  500 , or to have only adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506  at the border of the display area  500 . Light shielding effects can be achieved by either having only the color filter stack  220 , only the adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506 , or both.  \\n     THE THIRD EMBODIMENT  \\n      This embodiment mainly relates to improving the liquid crystal injection hole at the border of the display area of the TFT LCD panel. Referring to  FIG. 2 , the liquid crystal injection hole  700  is positioned at the border of the display area  500 . Liquid crystal can be injected from this hole.  \\n       FIGS. 7A and 7B  depict cross-sectional process views showing a method of fabricating a TFT LCD panel according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The third embodiment is similar to the second embodiment, except for the steps after forming the adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506 . Referring to  FIG. 7A , to facilitate injection of the liquid crystal, the liquid crystal injection hole  700  is made to have a larger diameter. Multiple color filter blocks can be formed on the portion of the substrate  202  that is exposed by the liquid crystal injection hole  700  to enhance the light shielding effect. For example, in these figures, three color filter blocks  314 ,  316 , and  318  are formed adjacent to each other at the position where the liquid crystal injection hole is located. These three color filter blocks are formed at the same time as when the color filter  314  and the color filter stack  220  of the second embodiment are formed.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 7B , a dielectric layer  322  is formed above the substrate  202 , in which the dielectric layer  322  covers the color filter blocks  314 ,  316 , and  318 . The remaining fabrication steps are similar to those of the second embodiment. In the third embodiment, although the color filter blocks  314 ,  316 , and  318 , and the adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506  are formed above the substrate, it is also possible to use other structures that have light shielding effects.  \\n       FIGS. 7B and 8  shows a structure of this embodiment, in which  FIG. 8  shows a top view of the TFT array substrate where the liquid crystal injection hole is located. Referring to  FIGS. 7B and 8 , a larger space is reserved between the TFT array substrate  202  and the opposite substrate  204  for the liquid crystal injection hole  700  ( FIG. 2 ) to facilitate injection of liquid crystal. The difference between the third embodiment and the second embodiment is that, in the third embodiment, the color filters are formed as blocks that are adjacent to each other to allow the height of the color filters to be lowered, so that the distance between the dielectric layer  322  and the substrate  202  meets the requirements for liquid crystal injection.  \\n      The TFT LCD panel according to the third embodiment can selectively use the adjacent or partially overlapping metal layers  502  and  506 , without using the color filters  314 ,  316 , and  318 , and still achieve the light shielding effect and prevent light leakage.  \\n     THE FOURTH EMBODIMENT  \\n      This embodiment is mainly relates to improvement in the repair structure of the TFT array substrate.  \\n       FIGS. 9A  to  9 C are cross-sectional process views showing a method of fabricating the TFT array substrate according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, which can be used with the fabrication process of the first embodiment.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 9A , a first metal layer is formed and patterned on the substrate  202  to form first repair metal layers  902  (there is one first repair metal layer, the plural term \\u201cfirst repair metal layers\\u201d refers to multiple portions of the first metal layer) in addition to the structure shown in  FIG. 3A . Afterwards, the processing steps are similar to the processing steps of the first embodiment. An insulation layer  304  is formed above the substrate  202 . A second metal layer is formed and patterned on the substrate  202  to form second repair metal layers  906  (there is one second repair metal layer, the plural term \\u201csecond repair metal layers\\u201d refers to multiple portions of the second repair metal layer) in addition to the structure shown in  FIG. 3A . The second repair metal layer  906  and the first repair metal layer  902  in combination form a repair structure. The repair metal layers  902  and  906  can be adjacent to each other or have portions that overlap, and are positioned within the pixel region  214  ( FIG. 2 ).  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 9B , a passivation layer  312  is formed above the substrate  202 , covering the second repair metal layer  906  and the insulation layer  304 . A color filter  314  and a color filter stack  220  (which is positioned above the color filter  314 ) can be formed in portions of the pixel region that are not directly above the second repair metal layer  906 . For example, the color filter stack  220  according to the first embodiment is formed above the TFT  216 . A dielectric layer  322  is formed above the substrate  202 , covering the entire substrate  202 .  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 9C , a dielectric layer  322  and a passivation layer  312  are defined to form an opening  910  for the welding point of the repair structure, and to expose the second repair metal layer  906 .  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 9D , a pixel electrode  218  is formed above the dielectric layer  322 . The pixel electrode  218  is electrically floated and disposed at the surface at the opening  910  to cover and protect the exposed second repair metal layer  906 . Layers other than the pixel electrode  218  can also be used as the passivation layer. Because the welding point (the opening  910 ) of the repair structure according to the present invention is protected by only a pixel electrode, dielectric layer bursts (which may occur in prior art structures) will not occur during the repair process.  \\n       FIGS. 9D and 10  show the structure of a TFT LCD panel according to the fourth embodiment, in which  FIG. 10  is a top view of a repair structure for a TFT array substrate according to the fourth embodiment of the invention.  \\n      Referring to  FIGS. 9D and 10 , the difference between the structures of the first and fourth embodiments is that, in the fourth embodiment, there is only one pixel electrode  218  that serves as a protection layer covering the welding point (which is at the opening  910 ) of the repair structure. The repair structure includes the first repair metal layer  902  and the second repair metal layer  906 . In addition, in the fourth embodiment, the color filter  314  and the color filter stack  220  are disposed at a location away from the welding point (which is at the opening  910 ).  \\n     THE FIFTH EMBODIMENT  \\n       FIGS. 11A  to  11 C are cross-sectional process views showing a method of fabricating a storage capacitor of the TFT array substrate according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. The fifth embodiment is similar to the fourth embodiment, wherein the difference between the fifth and fourth embodiments is that, the partially overlapping metal layers of the first metal layer that is formed and patterned above the substrate  202  has first storage capacitor metal layers  1102  (the plural term \\u201cfirst storage capacitor metal layers\\u201d refers to multiple portions of the first storage capacitor metal layer), as shown in  FIG. 11A , in addition to the structure shown in  FIG. 3A . The first storage capacitor metal layer  1102  has first openings  1103 , and the first storage capacitor metal layer  1102  can be a part of the scan line or a part of a common line. Afterwards, the processing steps are similar to those of the fourth embodiment. An insulation layer  304  is formed above the substrate  202 . A second metal layer is formed above the substrate  202 , and is patterned to have, in addition to the structure shown in  FIG. 3A , second storage capacitor metal layers  1106  (the plural term \\u201csecond storage capacitor metal layers\\u201d refers to multiple portions of the second storage capacitor metal layer). The second storage capacitor metal layer  1106  overlaps the insulation layer  304 , which overlaps the first storage capacitor metal layer  1102 . The second storage capacitor metal layer  1106 , the insulation layer  304 , and the first storage capacitor metal layer  1102  in combination form a storage capacitor.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 11B , a passivation layer  312  is formed above the substrate  202 , covering the second storage capacitor metal layer  1106  and the insulation layer  304 . A color filter  314 ,  316 , or  318  is formed above the portions of the passivation layer  312  that is outside of the opening  1103 . A dielectric layer  322  is formed above the substrate  202 . Here, the color filter  314 ,  316 , or  318  are used as the color filters of each pixel region.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 11C , the dielectric layer  322  and the passivation layer  312  are defined to form a second opening  1110  that serves as a contact window, and to expose the second storage capacitor metal layer  1106  that is above the first opening  1103 .  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 11D , a pixel electrode  218  is formed above the dielectric layer  322 , and is electrically connected to the second storage capacitor metal layer  1106  through the second opening  1110 . After the pixel electrode  218  is formed, a welding process can proceed to weld the pixel electrode  218  (which is at the second opening  1110 ) with the second storage capacitor metal layer  1106 . The first storage capacitor metal layer  1102  is positioned away from the second opening  1110  that serves as a contact window. When the pixel electrode  218  is welded to the second storage capacitor metal layer  1102  in order to fix poor electrical contacts, the short-circuiting of the first and second storage capacitor metal layers  1102  and  1106  can be avoided.  \\n       FIGS. 11D and 12  show the structure of the fifth embodiment, in which  FIG. 12  is a top view of a storage capacitor of the TFT array substrate according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention.  \\n      Referring to  FIGS. 11D and 12 , the fifth embodiment uses a welding point (which is the opening  1110 ) similar to the welding point of the repair structure of the fourth embodiment, a welding process can be used to weld the pixel electrode  218  and the second storage capacitor metal layer  1106  to prevent poor electrical contact at their interface and to improve the storage capacitor&#39;s storage capability. Because the first storage capacitor metal layer  1102  is positioned away from the contact window formed by the opening  1110 , during the welding process, the problem of short-circuiting the first and second storage capacitor metal layers can be avoided.  \\n      The present invention includes the following features:  \\n      1. The TFT array substrate according to the present invention uses overlapping color filters to replace the black matrix, the yield rate of the TFT LCD panel can be improved due to reduced errors in the alignment of the TFT array substrate and the opposite substrate.  \\n      2. The TFT array substrate can have, color filter stacks and metal layers that contact or partially overlap each other, at the borders of the display area to achieve a good light shielding effect.  \\n      3. Partially connected or partially overlapping metal layers are used at the liquid crystal injection hole at the border of the display area of the TFT array substrate. Color filter blocks can also be used to effectively shield light and to increase the size of the liquid crystal injection hole.  \\n      4. The welding point of the repair structure of the TFT array substrate is only covered by a single passivation layer, thus dielectric layer bursts (which may occur in a prior art structure that has a dielectric layer above the welding point) can be prevented during the repair process.  \\n      5. The TFT array substrate, which has integrated color filters, has storage capacitors having welding points similar to those used for repair structures. This can prevent poor electrical contact between the metal layer and the pixel electrode, and increase the effectiveness of the storage capacity. Because the first metal layer is positioned away from the opening used as the contact window, short-circuiting of the first and second metal layers during a welding process can be prevented.  \\n      In the present invention, by using the color filter stacks to replace the black matrix, the fabrication time and cost can be greatly reduced. Responsive to special requirements of different parts of the LCD panel, this invention provides improvements in the structure and the fabrication process of the LCD panel to save time and effort.  \\n      Although the present invention has been described using the embodiments above, the invention should not be limited to those embodiments, and can be modified by a person skilled in the art in various manners without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Field of the Invention  \\n      Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to device architectures. More specifically, the present invention relates to devices, e.g., memory devices, having spare input-output lines and to methods of using such devices.  \\n      2. Description of the Related Art  \\n      High reliability computers are often required in critical missions for medical, financial, and military applications. Such computers usually include processors and memory devices that manage and manipulate data to achieve mission objectives. Memory devices typically have input-output (I/O) lines that connect to memory \\u201ccells\\u201d that are organized into arrays. Such memory devices further include support circuitry that can access the individual memory cells by memory addresses and that can WRITE data into and READ data from addressed memory cells. Memory devices are often categorized by how wide their I/O ports are. Common memory device port widths are 4, 8, and 16 lines, which enables 4, 8, or 16 data bits to be input/output at a time.  \\n      Due to inherent processing limitations, it is not uncommon for one or more memory cells to be faulty. While a memory device may contain millions of memory cells, if even one memory cell is faulty the memory device is defective. To address this problem some memory device manufacturers have included \\u201credundant\\u201d memory cells that can be selectively used to repair faulty primary memory cells. Such repairs have been made by selectively activating \\u201cfuses\\u201d that are disposed in the memory device. Whenever a fuse is opened, routing logic accesses a redundant memory cell or array of redundant memory cells instead of the defective primary memory cell.  \\n      Although redundant memory cells are useful in improving manufacturing yields, even after manufacture memory devices can fail. Most failures are caused by a single bit error that results from the failure of a single memory cell or associated banks of memory cells. Logic is often utilized to detect faulty memory cells, typically during memory initialization e.g., during power-on or following a reset. When a memory cell is found faulty the memory address associated with that memory cell (or cells) is marked as \\u201cbad\\u201d and not used. Unfortunately, the computer may crash or become unusable until the failed memory device can be replaced. Such problems are simply not acceptable in mission critical systems.  \\n      One approach to improving reliability is to implement memory I/O with error correcting Code (ECC) capabilities. While this can greatly enhance reliability by enabling error correction and detection, additional memory to store the error correcting code is required. By using error correction and detection a defect on any particular I/O line can be found and corrected. Error correcting more than one I/O line, while possible, becomes fairly complicated and requires more memory. Typically, error correction is limited to one line while error detection is limited to two lines.  \\n      While common memory device port widths are 4, 8, and 16 lines, modern high-end processors have 32 or 64 (or greater) bit wide ports. To accommodate such port widths, memory devices are often arranged into memory modules.  FIG. 1  illustrates a typical prior art dual-inline memory module (DIMM)  100  that is used to supply memory for a 64-bit wide processor. The DIMM  100  includes 5 memory devices, the memory devices  102 ,  104 ,  106 ,  108 , and  110  that are mounted on a circuit card  112 . All of the memory devices are x16 (have 16 I/O lines). All of the I/O lines of the memory devices  102 ,  104 ,  106 ,  108  connect to DIMM contacts  116 . Those memory devices provide 64 I/O port connections for the processor (which is not shown). The memory device  110  only connects  8  of its 16 I/O lines to the DIMM contacts  116 . As shown, the other 8 I/O lines  120  are unused. Thus, DIMM  100  provides 72 I/O lines while 8 I/O lines are unused and represent wasted potential. While all I/O connections are shown in  FIG. 1 , in practice both sides of the DIMM  100  have contacts.  \\n      Therefore, a system architecture that makes use of unused I/O lines would be beneficial. Also beneficial would be a device architecture that enables a system supplier to make use of all available I/O pins. Also beneficial would be memory devices that enable a system designer to correct a memory system for defects.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The principles of the present invention provide for devices that can correct for internal defects by routing functions from an I/O line that is associated with an internal network to a redundant internal network. Those principles enable a supplier to provide for devices having spare I/O capacity. In such devices, such spare I/O capacity enables a system designer to swap good memory arrays for failing memory arrays without loss of functionality at the I/O level. An example of a device suitable for practicing the principles of the present invention is a memory device. A memory device that is in accord with the principles of the present invention includes the ability to route I/O signals on a port line that is associated with a failing memory array to and from an unused memory arrays without loss of functionality at the I/O level.  \\n      The principles of the present invention provide for devices that have a plurality of I/O lines, a plurality of internal networks (e.g., memory arrays), a plurality of multiplexers for routing signals from the individual I/O lines to the individual internal networks, and a multiplex controller for controlling the signal routing.  \\n      In one embodiment of the present invention the multiplex controller and the multiplexers can route signals to and from any I/O line to and from any of the internal networks (\\u201cany for any swapping\\u201d). Then, any signal to or from an I/O line that is originally associated with a defective internal network can be routed to and from a replacement internal network. If the device is a memory, signals on any I/O line can be routed into any memory array. In such cases, if required, the memory device can undergo a memory scrub in which good data in a defective memory array is moved into a replacement (spare) memory array. After the memory scrub, all READs and WRITES from and to the I/O port originally associated with the defective memory array can be directed to the replacement memory array. Error correcting codes (ECC) can be used to fix defective data as required.  \\n      In another embodiment of the present invention, data from the I/Os are shifted such that the defective internal network is unused. Shifting can be performed by shifting in one or more directions.  \\n      In another embodiment of the present invention data to and from the I/Os are routed through one multiplexer to other multiplexers, and then to the internal network. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present invention can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to various embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments.  \\n       FIG. 1  is a schematic illustration of a conventional DIMM card;  \\n       FIG. 2  is a schematic illustration of a computer system that incorporates the principles of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 3  is a schematic illustration of a DIMM card that is in accord with the principles of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4  is a simplified schematic depiction of a first embodiment memory device on the DIMM card of  FIG. 3 ;  \\n       FIG. 5  illustrates  8  of the memories illustrated in  FIG. 4  configured to provide a memory having a wider I/O bus;  \\n       FIG. 6  is a simplified schematic depiction of a second embodiment memory device on the DIMM card of  FIG. 3 ;  \\n       FIG. 7  is a simplified schematic depiction of a third embodiment memory device on the DIMM card of  FIG. 3 ; and  \\n       FIG. 8  is a simplified depiction of a memory system in which READ and WRITE signal paths are separated at the I/O lines. \\n    \\n    \\n      To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, wherever possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.  \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  \\n      The principles of the present invention provide for devices that can correct for defective internal networks by selectively routing signals on I/O lines to and from other internal networks. While the following detailed descriptions of embodiments of the present invention are all directed to memory devices, such embodiments are merely illustrative of the general principals and are not an exhaustive description of the possible ways to use the inventive technique. For example, the principles of the present invention are applicable to other types of devices. Therefore, one skilled in the art would be able to extend these principles to other applications.  \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates a computer  200  that incorporates the principles of the present invention. That computer  200  includes a processor  202  that is connected to a system memory  204  via a system bus  206 . For purposes of explanation, the processor will be described as having a 64 bit-wide word that communicates along a 72-line system bus  206  to a 72-line I/O system memory  204 . Of the 72 I/O lines, 64 are used to represent data and 8 bits are used for error correcting. In general, the processor and the bus will be able to process a W-bit wide word.  \\n      The system memory  206  includes random access memory (RAM)  208  that stores an operating system  210 , one or more application programs  212 , and program data  214 . The computer  200  also includes a hard drive  216  and/or an optical drive  218  and/or some other type of non-volatile memory for long-term storage of data. The computer  200  also includes input/output ports for a modem  220 , a keyboard  222 , a mouse  224 , network communication system  228 , a video adaptor  250  which drives a monitor  252 , and a printer  230 . While the computer  200  can be used for all of the normal functions that computers can be used for, the computer  200  has additionally error correcting capability. That error correcting capability is provided by the system memory  204  and by a control bus  280  that connects the processor  202  to the system memory  204 . While the control bus  280  might be part of the system bus  206 , they are specially identified because of their importance.  \\n      While the computer  200  is shown with a single system memory  204 , in practice memory can be associated with almost all of the computer elements. For example, the processor  202  can have local cache memory, as can the printer  230 , the video adaptor  250 , and many, possibly all, of the other computer elements. Each of those memories can benefit from the principles of the present invention.  \\n      The system memory  204  operatively connects to the system bus  206  such that each bus line connects to a memory I/O line.  FIG. 3  illustrates a dual-inline memory module (DIMM)  300  that is in accord with the principles of the present invention. The DIMM  300  includes 5 memory devices, the memory devices  302 ,  304 ,  306 ,  308 , and  310  that are mounted on a circuit card  312 . All of the memory devices are x16 (have 16 I/O lines) and all of the memory devices have I/O lines that operatively connect to the system bus  206 . Those I/O lines provide the required 64 I/O connections for the processor  202  and 8 I/O lines for error correction and detection. However, unlike in the DIMM  100 , in the DIMM  300  each of its memory devices ( 302 ,  304 ,  306 ,  308 , and  310 ) has at least one unconnected I/O line. Those unconnected I/O lines are lines  320 - 334 . Additionally, each of the memory devices  302 ,  304 ,  306 ,  308 , and  310  connect to the control bus  280 . Thus, unlike in the DIMM  100 , the unconnected I/O lines of DIMM  300  provide for error correction capability as provided below.  \\n      While the DIMM  300  represents a x72 system bus  206  in which 8 lines are unused, if the memory devices were x32 wide devices a x72 system bus would result in 24 unused I/O. If the system bus  206  was a x144 bus, 5 x32 memory devices could be used to drive the x144 interface, resulting in 16 I/O being unused (thus providing 3 or 4 extra I/O per memory device). Therefore, it should be understood that the DIMM  300  is simply an exemplary DIMM.  \\n      The internal organization of the individual memory devices  302 ,  304 ,  306 ,  308 , and  310  enable the error correction capability. A first embodiment memory device  400  is illustrated in  FIG. 4 . As show, that device has four I/O lines, I/O 0, I/O 1, I/O 2, and I/O 3. While for clarity only 4 I/O lines are illustrated, in practice the memory device  400  might include 8, 16, or more I/O lines. Each I/O line connects to a driver/receiver: I/O 0 connects to driver/receiver 0; I/O 1 connects to driver/receiver 1; I/O 2 connects to driver/receiver 2; and I/O 3 connects to driver/receiver 3. In turn, each driver/receiver connects to a 4-to-1 multiplexer: driver/receiver 0 connects to 4-to-1 multiplexer 0; driver/receiver 1 connects to 4-to-1 multiplexer 1; driver/receiver 2 connects to 4-to-1 multiplexer 2; and driver/receiver 3 connects to 4-to-1 multiplexer 3. Each of the 4-to-1 multiplexers connects to an associated array and to all of the other 4-1 multiplexers. Thus, 4-to-1 multiplexer 0 connects to array 0; 4-to-1 multiplexer 1 connects to array 1; 4-to-1 multiplexer 2 connects to array 2; and 4-to-1 multiplexer 3 connects to array 3.  \\n      Each of the 4-to-1 multiplexers can route data to or from its associated array (via lines  406 ), or to any of the other 4-to-1 multiplexers via lines  408 . Furthermore, each of the 4-to-1 multiplexers can apply information either from its associated array or from any of the other 4-to-1 multiplexers to its associated I/O line. Routing control is via a multiplex controller  402  that connects to each of the 4-to-1 multiplexers via lines  410 . The multiplex controller  402  is controlled by signals from the processor  202  via the bus  280 . Thus, the processor  202  can control which of the arrays (array 0 through array 3) each of the I/O lines (I/O 0 though I/O 3) WRITEs data into and READs data from. The memory  400  thus provides for \\u2018any for any\\u2019 swapping of I/O lines to arrays, and thus any of the I/O lines can be a spare I/O. While a singular spare I/O has been described, the general principles can be extended to multiple spare I/Os.  \\n      The operation of the device  400  is best illustrated by example. Assume that array 0 is defective and that I/O 3 is not used (a spare). Then, upon identification of array 0 being defective, the multiplexer control  402  can cause the 4-to-1 multiplexer 0 to route data to and from I/O 0 to and from the 4-to-1 multiplexer 3. The 4-to-1 multiplexer 3 then WRITEs data into and READs data from the array 3. Thus array 3 is substituted for the defective array 0. In such cases, if required, the memory device  400  can undergo a memory scrub in which good data in a defective memory array (array 0) is moved into a spare memory array (array 3). After the memory scrub, all READs and WRITES from and to the I/O port originally associated with the defective memory array are directed to the spare memory array. Error correcting codes (ECC) can be used to fix defective data as required. Scrubbing is beneficially performed by reading from the defective array, performing ECC, and then writing to the substitute array. When scrubbing is complete, all READ and WRITE operations are performed using the substitute array.  \\n      Again, while  FIG. 4  shows only 4 I/O lines, more than 4 I/O lines are contemplated (but are more complicated to show). In fact, in general N, where N is an integer greater than 2, of I/O lines can be used. Then, following the example of the embodiment of  FIG. 4 , the N multiplexers are each N-to-1 multiplexers, and each connects to (N\\u22121) other multiplexer and to a local array. Furthermore, there are N arrays.  \\n      The memory  400  can be configured into memory having more I/O lines in at least two basic ways. First, additional I/O lines (e.g. I/O 4-I/O 7) could be added, the multiplexers can be configured as 8-to-1 multiplexers, all of the 8-to-1 multiplexers can be connected to each other, and the multiplex controller  402  can be expanded to control all 8-to-1 multiplexers. This represents a simple expansion of the 4 I/O case to the 8 I/O case. Alternatively, a larger device, say an 8 I/O memory could be formed from two of the memories  400 . That case represents a simple cascading of separate memories.  \\n       FIG. 5  illustrates forming a memory  500  having quad 8 I/O lines sub-memories, the sub-memories  502 ,  504 ,  506 , and  508 , so as to provide 32 I/O lines. Each sub-memory is comprised of dual memories  400 . The control bus  280  controls each of dual memories  400 .  \\n      While the first embodiment memory  400  is highly beneficial in that it provides great flexibility in routing data into and out of arrays, it can be fairly complex to implement inside a single device. A second embodiment of the present invention is the memory  600  shown in  FIG. 6 . The memory  600  has four I/O lines, I/O 0, I/O 1, I/O 2, and I/O 3 (this can be expanded to 8, 16, 32 or greater numbers of I/O lines, in general N, where N is an integer). Each I/O line connects to a driver/receiver: I/O 0 connects to driver/receiver 0; I/O 1 connects to driver/receiver 1; I/O 2 connects to driver/receiver 2; and I/O 3 connects to driver/receiver 3. Driver/receiver 0 connects to a 2-to-1 multiplexer 0; driver/receiver 1 connects to a 3-to-1 multiplexer 1; driver/receiver 2 connects to a 3-to-1 multiplexer 2; and driver/receiver 3 connects to a 2-to-1 multiplexer 3. Each multiplexer connects to an associated array, and each receives control signals via lines  604  from a multiplex controller  606 . The operation of the multiplex controller  606  is controlled by signals from the processor  202  via the bus  280 . Thus, the processor  202  can control the memory  600 .  \\n      The multiplex controller  606  provides for data shift operations in which data is shifted from one multiplexer to a neighbor. For example, assume that I/O 0 is unconnected in the DIMM  300  (see  FIG. 3 ) and that array 3 is defective. In that case, the data on I/O 3 that would normally be stored in array 3 is shifted by 2-to-1 multiplexer 3 to 3-to-1 multiplexer 2, which then stores the shifted data (from I/O 3) into array 2. Then, the data on I/O 2 that would normally would be stored in array 2 is shifted by the 3-to-1 multiplexer 2 to the 3-to-1 multiplexer 1, which then stores the shifted data (from I/O 2) into the array 1. Finally, the data on I/O 1 that normally would be stored in array 1 is shifted by the 3-to-1 multiplexer 1 to the 2-to-1 multiplexer 0, which stores the shifted data (from I/O 1) into array 0. READ data is shifted the other direction. This shifting reduces the demands on the device multiplexers and on the multiplex controller, but at the cost of numerous shifts. Of course, the memory  600  can be used in place of the memory  400  in the memory  5  shown in  FIG. 5 .  \\n      Although memory  600  is more complicated than memory  400  at the system level, it is easier to implement at the memory device level. The added system level complexity includes tracking at which I/O the shifting begins and where the spare I/O is located. Memory scrubbing, if required, involves additional complexity.  \\n       FIG. 7  illustrates another memory  700  that is suitable for practicing the principles of the present invention. In this embodiment, I/O 0 is the spare I/O line. The memory  700  has four I/O lines, I/O 0, I/O 1, I/O 2, and I/O 3 (this can be expanded to 8, 16, 32 or greater numbers of I/O lines, in general N I/O lines). Each I/O line connects to a driver/receiver: I/O 0 connects to driver/receiver 0; I/O 1 connects to driver/receiver 1; I/O 2 connects to driver/receiver 2; and I/O 3 connects to driver/receiver 3. Driver/receiver 0 connects to a 4-to-1 multiplexer 0; driver/receiver 1 connects to a 2-to-1 multiplexer 1; driver/receiver 2 connects to a 2-to-1 multiplexer 2; and driver/receiver 3 connects to a 2-to-1 multiplexer 3. Each multiplexer connects to an associated array, and each receives control signals via lines  704  from a multiplex controller  706 . Furthermore, each 2-to-1 multiplexer connects to the 4-to-1 multiplexer 0. The operation of the multiplex controller  706  is controlled by signals from the processor  202  via the bus  280 . Thus, the processor  202  controls the memory  700 .  \\n      The multiplex controller  706  provides for data steering operations in which data can be steered from or to the 4-to-1 multiplexer 0. For example, with I/O 0 unconnected in the DIMM  300  (see  FIG. 3 ), assume that array 1 is defective. In that case, the data on I/O 1 that normally would be stored in array 1 is steered by the 2-to-1 multiplexer 1 to the 4-to-1 multiplexer 0. In turn, the 4-to-1 multiplexer 0 steers the data from I/O 1 to array 0. Data is READ by steering in the reverse direction. This system reduces the demands on the device multiplexers and on the multiplex controller, but at the cost of multiple bits being handled, albeit with fewer bit handling steps than with the memory  600 . Of course, the memory  700  can be used in place of the memory  400  in the memory  5  shown in  FIG. 5 .  \\n      The foregoing has been described using a single multiplexer on each I/O line. However, there are other ways to implement multiplexing. For example,  FIG. 8  shows a simplified depiction of a memory system  800  in which READ and WRITE signal paths are separated at the I/O lines. While  FIG. 8  shows only one I/O line, it should be understood that each I/O line of the memory system  800  can use READ and WRITE path splitting. As shown, the I/O 0 line is applied to a receiver  802  and to a driver  804 . The receiver  802  sends it signals to a receiver multiplexer  806 . For simplicity, it is assumed that the receiver multiplexer  806  is a 4-to-1 multiplexer. The receiver multiplexer  806  connects to the receiver  802 , to an Array 0, and to the other receivers and to a multiplexer controller (which are not shown for clarity) via buses  808 . Signals to be stored in the Array 0 are routed through the receiver multiplexer  806 . Furthermore, the receiver  802  also connects to the other multiplexers via a bus  810 .  \\n      Still referring to  FIG. 8 , the driver  804  connects to a driver multiplexer  814 . The driver multiplexer  814  connects to the other arrays and to the multiplexer controller (which are not shown for clarity) via busses  816 . The driver multiplexer  814  also connects to the Array 0.  \\n      The operation of the system  800  is straightforward. When a WRITE signal is applied to I/O 0, the receiver  802  sends that WRITE signal to its receiver multiplexer  806  and to the other receiver multiplexers. The multiplexer controller then controls which array stores the WRITE signal on I/O 0. If Array 0 is to store the WRITE signal, the receiver multiplexer  806  writes information into Array 0. During a READ, the multiplex controller determines which Array is to be read from. Assuming that I/O 0 is to send the read data, that data is routed through the driver multiplexer  814  to the driver  804 . If data is being read from Array 0, that information is directly applied to the driver multiplexer  814 . Otherwise, alternate array data is steered directly to the driver  804 . Having dedicated multiplexers for the READ and WRITE paths avoids problems associated with having a single multiplexer handle both paths, e.g., having to worry about bi-directional drivers and their required control.  \\n      A common theme of the various embodiments of the present invention is the use of spare I/O lines, lines that exist in many systems and that consequently go unused, and spare internal networks (such as memory arrays). By distributing the spare I/O lines across multiple devices, and by incorporating internal multiplex controllers and internal multiplexers, signals to and from defective internal networks can be re-routed to functional internal networks. For example, data that would normally go to a defective memory array can be re-routed to a functional array. It should be noted that no additional I/O lines are required. In the case of memory devices, the present invention can be made fully compatible with existing ECC schemes, including those that use conventional sparing techniques. Additionally, devices that are in accord with the principles of the present invention can \\u201crepair\\u201d internal defects. In practice a complex system can remain fully functional when it would normally crash because of a device defect. All this capability is made available by a small amount of additional logic.  \\n      While the foregoing has described swapping entire arrays when a fault occurs, with additional logic it is possible to segment an array&#39;s address space such that sparing is done on a partial array basis (\\u00bd the address space, \\u00bc the address space, on a logical bank by logical bank basis, etc.). With such capability, a \\u201cdefective\\u201d array could be used until the fault address, and then data can be steered to a spare array. Furthermore, one spare array could be used to store data swapped into it from multiple defective arrays. This will require a multiplex controller and a processor that dynamically steer signals depending upon the address of the command.  \\n      When implementing a system that uses the principles of the present invention the designated spare I/O lines must be identified. Identification can be accomplished at design time, by testing, or by programming, e.g., mode register (MRS or EMRS in industry nomenclature) programming such as is required by many industry standard memory devices today (SDR SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, etc.). The MRS/EMRS command could be followed at a deterministic time later (3, 4, 5, cycles) where all connected data pins would be toggled (0101 or 1010 pattern). All pins toggling would be identified as \\u2018not spare\\u2019 (the default state perhaps), and all I/O remaining static as spare. Conversely spare I/O could intentionally be tied low and all connected I/O could be driven high for identification as well. In either case, the spare/not spare I/O information is saved for each device. Devices that don&#39;t have this function used would have all I/O identified as not spare, which would prevent them from being spared out in subsequent swap commands/sequences. If multiple spare I/O lines exist, the order of replacement could be as simple as low order for first repair, next lowest order for 2nd repair, and so on. The control multiplexer could simply change the steering at the I/O to be replaced such that the first (or only) spare I/O array is used.  \\n      The principles of the present invention also enable fault isolation. For example, assume that a system has detected a memory fault on an I/O. If the memory array output is moved such that the contents of the array associated with the I/O fault is output on another I/O and the data on that other I/O still reads in error, then the fault is with the array. However, if the swap causes the data to be successfully read, then the fault is somewhere in the electrical path associated with the driver/receiver, or the I/O port.  \\n      While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005099951-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"Ethernet OAM connectivity check may be used to detect connectivity failures across a given pair of network elements on an Ethernet network.

Field of the Invention  \\n      The present invention relates to communication networks and, more particularly, to Ethernet Operation Administration and Maintenance (OAM) domains and an Ethernet OAM frame format.  \\n      2. Description of the Related Art  \\n      Data communication networks may include various computers, servers, nodes, routers, switches, bridges, hubs, proxies, and other network devices coupled together and configured to pass data to one another. These devices will be referred to herein as \\u201cnetwork elements.\\u201d Data is communicated through the data communication network by passing protocol data units, such as frames, packets, cells, or segments, between the network elements by utilizing one or more communication links. A particular protocol data unit may be handled by multiple network elements and cross multiple communication links as it travels between its source and its destination over the network.  \\n      The various network elements on the communication network communicate with each other using predefined sets of rules, referred to herein as protocols. Different protocols are used to govern different aspects of the communication, such as how signals should be formed for transmission between network elements, various aspects of what the protocol data units should look like, how packets should be handled or routed through the network by the network elements, and how information associated with routing information should be exchanged between the network elements.  \\n      Ethernet is a well known networking protocol that has been defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as standard 802. Conventionally, Ethernet has been used to implement networks in enterprises such as businesses and campuses, and other technologies have been used to transport network traffic over longer distances. Specifically, network providers such as carriers were reluctant to deploy networks based on Ethernet technology, since Ethernet is designed to provide best efforts service and doesn&#39;t support Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions desired by the network providers. Since network providers need to be able to guarantee connectivity, Ethernet was felt to be inappropriate for deployment in these types of networks. When two Ethernet networks were to be connected over a network provider&#39;s network, the Ethernet frames would be converted to protocol data units using a transport protocol such as ATM, and carried over the network using the carrier&#39;s transport protocol. The Ethernet frames would then be recovered at the other side of the network provider&#39;s network and passed onto the second Ethernet network.  \\n      As the underlying networks have evolved and more and more Ethernet networks are being connected together, it has become more desirable to transport Ethernet frames in native form over the network provider&#39;s networks. Unfortunately, although it may be possible to overcome the limitations associated with the best-efforts nature of the Ethernet technology, other aspects of the Ethernet protocol still remain to be solved. For example, Ethernet does not enable certain Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) operations to take place to manage and diagnose problems on the network. This lack of OAM support in Ethernet prevents the network provider from taking measurements to perform fault detection, isolation, confirmation, and many other operations that a network provider or subscriber may wish to be able to do on the network. As Ethernet has expanded beyond a single domain, the ability to detect and isolate a network fault becomes more difficult rendering it necessary to implement OAM across Ethernet domain boundaries.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      Faults may be detected in an Ethernet network using Ethernet OAM connectivity check functions to detect connectivity failures across a given pair of network elements. The connectivity checks may be applied on a network level or applied on a per service level. According to an embodiment of the invention, connectivity check frames are generated and sent to either a specific unicast destination address (DA) or a multicast DA. Conditions associated with the frame could be that all edge network elements should receive the connectivity check, when connectivity check is applied on a network level, or that all edge network elements participating in a common service instance should receive the connectivity check, when connectivity check is applied on a per service level. Upon reception of the first connectivity check from a particular network element, the receiving network element identifies connectivity with the sending network element, either at the network level or on a per service basis, and expects to receive further periodic connectivity check frames from that network element. If the receiving network element stops receiving periodic connectivity checks from the sending network element, it detects that connectivity to the sending network element is broken. Following detection of connectivity failure, the detecting network element may notify the operator or initiate fault verification, followed by an optional fault isolation step.  \\n      A connectivity check may be initiated either on-demand via an operator or management systems initiated action or may be performed periodically. When performed periodically, the periodicity at which connectivity checks are performed may be configurable, although a default value such as a 10 second interval may also be established. Optionally, to prevent a dropped connectivity check frame from causing an unwarranted connectivity failure determination, a connectivity failure may require a larger number of consecutive frame losses, such as three consecutive connectivity check losses.  \\n      Once a fault is identified, it may be advantageous to verify the fault before taking corrective action or in connection with taking corrective action on the network. According to an embodiment of the invention, OAM loopback may be used to confirm the existence of a fault in the Ethernet network. In this embodiment, OAM loopback causes a network element receiving an Ethernet frame from a network element to transmit a corresponding frame back to the original network element.  \\n      Loopback functions may be implemented on a network in several ways, for example by using an intrusive loopback or using non-intrusive loopback. Intrusive loopback is used to place a remote network element in a continuous loopback such that all received frames would be looped back except OAM frames. Since this function results in loopback of data frames, the data path is impacted. Since the datapath is affected, this loopback mode is considered to be intrusive. The remote network element is expected to swap source and destination MAC addresses. Non-intrusive loopback is performed by sending OAM frames to remote network element(s) and expecting a response back which verifies connectivity. Since the service data frames are not looped back, and the data path is therefore not impacted, this loopback mode is considered to be non-intrusive. Non-intrusive loopback requests may be generated by a network element either automatically following detection of connectivity failure, where detection could be done using a connectivity check function, or on-demand via operator or management system initiated commands. Other modes may be used as well and the invention is not limited to these several embodiments. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      Aspects of the present invention are pointed out with particularity in the appended claims. The present invention is illustrated by way of example in the following drawings in which like references indicate similar elements.

However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, protocols, algorithms, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention.  \\n       FIG. 1  illustrates an example of a network topology in which customer sites  10  running a conventional protocol such as Ethernet are interconnected over a network  12 . Multiple carriers  14  may participate in handling data flowing between the sites over the network, and each of the carrier networks may have multiple domains. Each customer site  10  is connected to the provider&#39;s  12  using a Customer Edge (CE) network element  16 . Network elements within the provider&#39;s network that interface CE network elements will be referred to herein as Provider Edge (PE) network elements  18 , and network elements within the provider&#39;s network that only interface other provider network elements and do not interface CE network elements will be referred to as Provider (P) network elements  20 .  \\n      Interfaces on P, PE, and CE network elements may be configured to implement a protocol such as User to Network Interface (UNI), Network to Network Interface (NNI) or another protocol. These interfaces may serve as reference points in the network and can be managed using OAM flows.  \\n      Network management may be handled centrally, via one or more network management stations  21 , or may be done on the network elements in a distributed fashion. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 1 , a network management station  21  interfaces with the networks  10 ,  12 ,  14 , to enable OAM operations to take place on the networks. Each network  10 ,  12 ,  14 , may have its own network management station or they may connect to a common management station. The network management station may be connected to all network elements within a domain/network, or may be connected to select network elements, for example the edge network elements (PEs)  18 . The invention is not limited to the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 1 .  \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates one embodiment of a network element that may be configured to implement an embodiment of the invention. The network element may be used to implement one of the CE  16 , PE  18 , or P  20  network elements of  FIG. 1 . The invention is not limited to a network element configured as illustrated, however, as the invention may be implemented on a network element configured in many different ways. The discussion of the specific structure and methods of operation of the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 2  is intended only to provide one example of how the invention may be used and implemented in a particular instance. The invention more broadly may be used in connection with any network element configured to handle Ethernet frames in a communications network.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 2 , the network element generally includes Input/Output (I/O) cards  22  configured to connect to links in the communications network. The I/O cards  22  may include physical interfaces, such as optical ports, electrical ports, wireless ports, infrared ports, or ports configured to communicate with other conventional physical media, as well as configurable logical elements capable of operating as MAC (layer  2 ) ports under the direction of an interface manager, described in greater detail below.  \\n      One or more forwarding engines  24  are provided in the network element to process frames received over the I/O cards  22 . The forwarding engines  24  forward frames to a switch fabric interface  26 , which passes the packets to a switch fabric  28 . The switch fabric  28  enables a frame entering on a port on one or more I/O cards  22  to be output at one or more different ports in a conventional manner. A frame returning from the switch fabric  28  is received by one of the forwarding engines  24  and passed to one or more I/O cards  22 . The frame may be handled by the same forwarding engine  24  on both the ingress and egress paths. Optionally, where more than one forwarding engine  24  is included in the network element  20 , a given frame may be handled by different forwarding engines on the ingress and egress paths. The invention is not limited to any particular forwarding engine  24 , switch fabric interface  26 , or switch fabric  28 , but rather may be implemented in any suitable network element configured to handle Ethernet frames on a network. One or more Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)  30 ,  32  and processors  34 ,  36  may be provided to implement instructions and processes on the forwarding engines  24 . Optionally, a memory  38  may be included to store data and instructions for use by the forwarding engines.  \\n      An interface management system  40 , optionally containing one or more control cards  42  and one or more data service cards  44 , may be provided to create and manage interfaces on the network element. The interface management system may interact with an OAM module  46  locally instantiated on the network element or interfaced to the network element over a management interface port  48 . The OAM module  46  may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or in any other manner as discussed in greater detail here.  \\n      As discussed in greater detail below, Ethernet OAM may allow network level OAM functions to be supported on the network, and may also allow service level Ethernet OAM functions to be supported on the network element. The following description will contain several sections. In the first section, a notion of Ethernet OAM domains will be introduced, and an OAM frame format will be introduced to support OAM operations within the domain (intra-domain) and between domains (inter-domain). The second section will describe how Ethernet OAM frames may be used to monitor performance for intra-domain and inter-domain flows. The third section will describe intra-domain and inter-domain fault detection and verification, and the fourth section will describe intra-domain and inter-domain fault isolation.  \\n      Part 1\\u2014Ethernet OAM Domains and Ethernet OAM Frame Format  \\n      Ethernet OAM domains and OAM flow identifiers are described in greater detail in Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60/518,910, filed Nov. 10, 2003, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. As discussed in greater detail below, OAM domains and OAM flow identifiers may be used to perform OAM functions in Ethernet domains by enabling network elements within the domains to filter OAM frames based on OAM domain and OAM flow identifier.  \\n      To enable network providers to use Ethernet technology in their carrier networks, Ethernet OAM should be able to operate within a domain (such as within a provider&#39;s domain), between domains (such as between domains owned by one provider or between domains owned by multiple providers), and should be able to take place in a point-to-point, a point-to-multipoint, a multipoint to point, or a multipoint to multipoint manner. The reason for these requirements, is that a given service for a subscriber may cross multiple domains owned and operated by multiple different parties. For example, a subscriber may have one office in a first city and another office in another city. The metropolitan carrier in each city may be different, and a third carrier may provide the long haul connectivity between the metropolitan areas. If Ethernet technology is to be used to support the transmissions end-to-end across the multiple carriers, OAM will need to be implemented within each domain and between domains.  \\n      Network elements placed at an administrative boundary of a provider&#39;s network serve as edge network elements for that provider network and handle the ingress and egress of network flows to/from the provider network. When an edge network element performs a hand-off of an Ethernet layer flow, to an edge network element of another provider, that network element serves as an edge hand-off network element. Not all edge network elements are edge hand-off network elements, as some edge network elements will not interface with other provider edge network elements. Those network elements that are not associated with the ingress, egress or hand-offs of network flows serve as interior network elements.  \\n      Additional administrative boundaries may exist within a single provider network to separate the provider network into domains. Network elements within the domain may similarly be classified as edge, edge hand-off, and interior network elements within each such administrative boundary.  \\n      OAM flows can be inserted and extracted at reference points within the network, namely at flow points and termination flow points. According to an embodiment of the invention, the following OAM flows may be defined: \\n          Customer UNI-UNI flow between reference points on the customer side of the UNI.     Provider UNI-UNI flow between reference points on the provider side of the UNI     Segment OAM flows:     Between flow points on the boundary of a provider network;     Between flow points on the boundaries of two adjacent provider networks; and     Between any flow points as required;     Ethernet Physical Layer (ETY) link OAM flows. \\n \\n Other OAM flows may be identified as well and the invention is not limited to the particular identified OAM flows. \\n       \\n\\n      Depending on the type of OAM flow, a provider may seek to limit the flow to maintain it within its administrative boundary. For example, the provider may wish to create segment OAM flows between flow points on a domain boundary that are not allowed to reach a customer network or another provider&#39;s network. Similarly, the network providers may wish to create segment OAM flows between flow points on boundaries of their provider networks that are not allowed to reach a customer&#39;s network or another provider&#39;s network. Therefore, an OAM service may be carried across a single or multiple OAM domains.  \\n      Ports on a network element in an OAM domain can be classified as interior or exterior to a particular OAM domain. Interior ports are those on which OAM frames, belonging to an OAM flow, are recognized and processed. Processing may result in either termination of the OAM flow or transmission of the OAM flow from one or more other ports on the network element. Ports not interior to a domain are exterior ports. An edge network element has both interior and exterior ports to an OAM domain, while an interior network element has all its ports marked as interior ports to that OAM domain.  \\n      Within an OAM domain, OAM flows may be applicable between edge network elements only (an edge hand-off network element is also an edge network element) or across all network elements (i.e. including all interior network elements and edge network elements).  \\n      OAM frames can be unicast or multicast frames. The difference between the two is based on the destination MAC address (DA). A unicast OAM frame has a unicast DA while a multicast OAM frame has the multicast bit set in the frame DA and thus has a multicast DA. A multicast OAM frame can associate itself to all edge networks elements or all network elements inside a domain, based on its multicast DA. According to an embodiment of the invention, the network elements support two types of OAM multicast DAs: all edge bridges multicast DA; and all bridges multicast DA. Other multicast DAs may be used as well, and the invention is not limited to an embodiment that supports only these two types of multicast DAs.  \\n      Different OAM flows can be identified by using OAM flow identifiers within the OAM frames. OAM flow identifiers can assume many values. Several examples of which are set forth below. The invention is not limited to these values, however: \\n          UNI-UNI Customer \\u2014a Customer UNI-UNI flow between reference points on the customer side of the UNI;     UNI-UNI Provider \\u2014a Provider UNI-UNI flow between reference points on the provider side of the UNI;     Segment inter-provider \\u2014a Segment OAM flow between flow points within the boundary of a provider network. This may include an OAM flow between flow points on the boundary of a provider network or between any flow points within a provider network as required.     Segment inter-provider \\u2014a segment OAM flow between flow points inside the boundaries of two or more provider networks. This may include an OAM flow between flow points on the boundaries of two or more adjacent provider networks or between any flow points inside the boundaries of two or more provider networks, as required. Under special cases, the flow identifier Segment inter-provider  may operate the same as the flow identifier UNI-UNI Provider .     UNI Segment \\u2014an OAM flow between reference points (i.e. Termination Flow Point (TFP and Flow Point (FP)) on the customer side and provider side of the UNI.     NNI segment \\u2014an OAM flow between flow points on two edge hand-off network elements connected to each other. Each edge hand-off network element belongs to a different provider network.     UNI Link \\u2014If the UNI is realized using a single Ethernet Physical Layer (ETY) link, this OAM flow can be used for the ETY link between customer and provider networks.     Transit Link \\u2014this OAM flow can be used for any intermediate ETY link between network elements. \\n \\n Of these flow identifiers, UNI Link  and Transit Link  can be based on a proposed standard being discussed in the IEEE 802.3ah. The other flow identifiers may be defined as discussed in greater detail herein. Also, although multiple different OAM flows have been identified, not all will be applicable for all services and/or business models, particularly with multiple provider scenarios. Thus, the invention is not limited to an embodiment that supports all of these particular or only these particular listed flow identifiers. \\n       \\n\\n      A combination of the two types of OAM Multicast DA and the OAM Flow identifiers, as discussed above, can allow OAM flows to be created for multiple different maintenance entities. By filtering based on OAM flow identifiers, edge network elements can protect the domain from external sources of OAM frames, and ensure that OAM frames do not leak outside the domain.  \\n       FIG. 3  illustrates an example of a point-to-point flow reference model for an Ethernet layer network. In  FIG. 3 , network elements A and F are customer network elements, network elements B and C are edge network elements of provider X 1  and network elements D and E are edge network element of provider X 2 . Network elements C and D are also edge hand-off network elements since they hand-off Ethernet OAM flows between the X 1  and X 2  domains. It will be assumed for the purposes of this example that there are other edge and interior network element in both provider X 1  and provider X 2  networks.  \\n      A provider UNI-UNI OAM flow can be generated at B (with a Unicast DA=MAC address on E) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=UNI-UNI Provider ). This OAM frame gets forwarded to E based on its Unicast DA.  \\n      When a similar provider UNI-UNI Multicast OAM flow is needed, it can be generated at B (with a multicast DA=all edge bridges multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=UNI-UNI Provider ). As a result, all edge network elements within provider X 1  OAM domain receive this OAM frame. When C receives this OAM frame, it recognizes it and processes it, as C is an edge network element. Since the OAM flow identifier=UNI-UNI Provider , C also forwards the OAM frame to D. When D receives this frame, it recognizes it and processes it. D also forwards this frame to all other edge network elements within provider X 2  OAM domain. When this OAM frame reaches E, it recognizes it and processes it. However, since the OAM frame is not meant to be sent to the customer network, E terminates the OAM frame.  \\n      If a segment multicast OAM flow is needed within the edge devices of provider X 1  network, it can be generated at B (with a multicast DA=all edge bridges multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ). As a result, all edge network elements within provider X 1  OAM domain will receive this OAM frame. When C receives this OAM frame, it recognizes it and processes it, since C is an edge network element. Since identifier=Segment intra-provider , C will terminate the OAM frame and will not forward the OAM frame to D.  \\n      If a segment multicast OAM flow is needed across all devices of provider X 1  network, it can be generated at B (with a multicast DA=all bridges multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ). As a result, all network elements within provider X 1  OAM domain receive this OAM frame. When C receives this OAM frame, it recognizes it and processes it. Since identifier=Segment intra-provider , C terminates the OAM frame and does not forwards the OAM frame to D.  \\n      According to an embodiment of the invention, the value of the flow identifier may be compared using a simple algebraic comparison with a reference to determine whether the OAM frame should be passed or dropped. For example, in one embodiment, the value of the OAM flow identifiers can be set so that filtering can be done based on whether the OAM frame entering or exiting a domain has an OAM flow identifier value smaller than a minimum OAM flow identifier configured on the interior and/or exterior ports of the domain. For example, if the following octet values are assigned to OAM flow identifiers: \\n          UNI-UNI Customer =255 (0xFF);     UNI-UNI Provider =253 (0xFD);     Segment inter-provider =251 (0xFB);     NNI Segment =249 (0xF9);     UNI Segment =247 (0xF7);     Segment intra-provider =245 (0xF5);     UNI Link =243 (0xF3); and     Transit Link =241 (0xF1).        \\n\\n      If the following minimum OAM flow identifier values are configured across the different ports, NNI port=249 (0xF9), UNI port=247 (0xF7), and Interior port=245 (0xF5), then filtering at edge network elements can be achieved such that OAM frames with OAM Flow identifiers smaller than the minimum OAM flow identifier are not allowed into or out of the OAM domain. The invention is not limited to this embodiment, however, as other manners of filtering may be performed as well. For example, the network elements may be configured to look for particular values or ranges of values depending on the function of the network element or port and the manner in which the OAM flow identifiers are implemented. Thus, the invention is not limited to the particular examples set forth above.  \\n      Part 1B\\u2014Ethernet OAM Frame Format  \\n      To enable OAM frames to be handled by network elements in an Ethernet domain and between Ethernet domains, an Ethernet OAM frame format is defined, according to one embodiment of the invention, which can be applied to all Ethernet OAM messages. Ethernet OAM can be used for both facility OAM and service OAM, in which a service OAM flow is associated with a specific service instance, and a facility OAM flow is not associated with a specific service instance.  \\n      Although OAM frames may be defined in a number of different ways, according to an embodiment of the invention, the OAM frame format may be arranged as illustrated in  FIG. 4 . The invention is not limited to this embodiment, however, as other frame formats may be used as well.  \\n      Ethernet OAM frames can be Unicast or Multicast, and this distinction is based on the frame&#39;s destination MAC address (DA). The OAM DA field  50  is a 6-Octet field that identifies the destination address of the OAM frame. The DA can be a unicast address of a specific bridge, or a multicast address corresponding to a group of bridges, such as a DA associated with an all edge bridges multicast address, or an all bridges multicast address. Other multicast addresses may be used as well. According to an embodiment of the invention, the Ethernet OAM frame format supports two types of multicast DAs: an all edge bridges multicast DA, and an all bridges multicast DA. The invention is not limited in this manner, however, as other forms of multicast DAs may be used as well.  \\n      The OAM MAC Source Address (SA) field  52  is a 6-Octet field that identifies the source address of the OAM frame. The Source Address (SA) can either be a unique address identifying the source bridge (a unique unicast MAC address assigned to the source bridge for OAM functionality) or can be the MAC address of a bridge port over which the OAM frame was sourced.  \\n      Ethernet OAM frames may be differentiated from data frames based on a pre-defined EtherType  54 . The OAM EtherType may be defined in a number of ways, and the invention is not limited to a particular OAM EtherType definition. Multicast Ethernet OAM frames can also be differentiated based on either of the above two mentioned DAs.  \\n      An optional VLAN tag  56  may be used to identify a VLAN corresponding to the OAM message. When used, this VLAN tag may identify a service instance to which this OAM frame is associated, although the VLAN tag may also be used for other purposes as well.  \\n      The EtherType (VLAN) and VLAN Tag fields form a 4-octet field and are present when the OAM frame is associated with a service instance. In this case, this VLAN tag identifies the associated service instance.  \\n      The EtherType (OAM)  58  is a 2-octet field containing a unique EtherType value that identifies a frame as an OAM frame.  \\n      Different OAM flows can be identified by using an OAM Flow ID  60  within the OAM frame. The OAM Flow ID is a 1-octet field that identifies the OAM flow to which the OAM frame belongs. The OAM flow identifier is used to filter an OAM frame from entering or leaving an OAM domain. OAM flow identifiers are described in greater detail above, although the invention is not limited to these particular described flow identifiers as other flow identifiers may be used as well.  \\n      The OAM OpCode field  62  is a 1-Octet field that identifies the OAM function of the OAM frame. Several different OAM functions may be defined by the OpCode. For example, the OpCode may define OAM functions such as intrusive loopback, non-intrusive loopback, path trace, connectivity check, performance monitoring, Alarm Indicator Signals (AIS), Remote Defect Indicators (RDI), and vendor specific functions which may allow organizations to extend OAM functions in various proprietary ways. Several of these OAM functions will be discussed in greater detail below. Examples of the values that may be assigned to the OAM OpCode field include: \\n          Intrusive Loopback Request (0x00);     Intrusive Loopback Release (0x01);     Intrusive Loopback Reply (0x02);     Non-Intrusive Loopback Request (0x03);     Non-Intrusive Loopback Reply (0x04);     Path Trace Request (0x05);     Path Trace Response (0x06);     Connectivity Check (0x07);     Performance Monitoring Request (0x08);     Performance Monitoring Reply (0x09);     Alarm Indicator Signals (AIS), (0x0A);     Remote Defect Indicators (RDI) (0x0B); and     Vendor Specific (0xFF)\\u2014The vendor specific op-code is provided to allow vendors or other organizations to extend OAM functions in proprietary ways. \\n \\n Other OpCode field values may be assigned as well and the invention is not limited to an embodiment using these particular described OpCode values. \\n       \\n\\n      The OAM frame body is associated with the corresponding OAM OpCode. Based on the information required for the corresponding OAM function, identified using the OAM OpCode, a specific format of the OAM body can be specified.  \\n      An optional Service ID  66  TLV (type  68 , length  70 , value  72 ) may be used in the body of an OAM frame, when this frame is associated with a Service OAM. Use of a Service ID TLV, in addition to the optional VLAN tag  56  in the OAM frame header  68 , provides another way to identify the service, other than the VLAN tag  56 . This may be used, for example, to accommodate hierarchal VLANs, enable the OAM frames to carry unique global service IDs, and to enable other functions to be implemented using the OAM frames.  \\n      Additionally, use of a service ID TLV  66 , in addition to the optional VLAN tag  56  in the OAM frame header  68 , enables the service ID to be the same as the optional VLAN tag in the OAM header, thus allowing validation of OAM frames. Additionally, the service ID allows the service to be differentiated in the network from other services to enable particular OAM features to be provided per-service in the network. The service ID Type-Length-Value (TLV) field is a variable length field which is optional, and is present when the OAM frame is associated with a service instance, in which case the TLV portion identifies the associated service instance. Although the service ID has been illustrated herein as a TLV field in the Ethernet OAM frame body, the invention is not limited in this manner as the service ID may take other forms and be located at other locations in the Ethernet OAM frame, such as in the frame header.  \\n      The OAM data field  74  is a variable length field that is associated with the corresponding OAM OpCode and is specified for each OAM function. Since Ethernet OAM frames will be forwarded on the network using standard Ethernet forwarding techniques, an OAM frame including an OAM data portion must result in an Ethernet frame with a valid length as set forth in the IEEE 802 Ethernet standard. Therefore, if necessary, the OAM frame may be padded with zeros or other information/data to achieve a valid minimum frame size.  \\n      The frame check sequence (FCS) field  76  is a four byte field that carries the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits for the frame in a conventional manner.  \\n      As discussed above, using the notion of OAM domains it is possible to specify the manner in which OAM flows are handled and propagate on the Ethernet network. The OAM frame format, described above, contains fields to enable the frame to operate within the OAM domains and allow the network elements deployed in the network to handle the OAM frames in the intended manner. Other OAM frame formats may be developed as well, and the invention is not limited to this illustrated embodiment.  \\n      Part 2\\u2014Ethernet OAM Performance Management  \\n      A method and apparatus for using OAM in an Ethernet network for performance management is described in greater detail in Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60/535,018, filed Jan. 7, 2004, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.  \\n      When subscribing to an Ethernet service, measurement of service performance becomes a requirement for service providers and optionally its customers, since such measurements can be applied towards evaluating adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLA) between the provider and customer. The performance parameters that need to be measured and mechanisms used for these measurements can be discussed in terms of the maintenance entities (MEs) and information elements that need to be supported as part of the Ethernet OAM environment. According to an embodiment of the invention, a method and apparatus for defining these parameters and information elements is provided along with a method and apparatus for measuring service performance in an Ethernet network. Additionally, the use of currently available management objects for performance management across Ethernet networks is provided.  \\n      Maintenance Entities  \\n      G.8010 provides point-to-point connectivity service types for both single operator and multi-operator scenarios.  FIGS. 5 and 6  illustrate point-to-point Ethernet connectivity administrative domains associated with management entities, and  FIG. 7  illustrates multipoint Ethernet connectivity administrative domains associated with management entities.  \\n      For point-to-point service types as illustrated in  FIGS. 5 and 6 , several maintenance entities are of particular interest. These maintenance entities include a maintenance entity between the customer flow points (UNI_C to UNI_C), a maintenance entity between network provider flow points (UNI_N to UNI_N), access link maintenance entities, intra-domain maintenance entities, and inter-domain maintenance entities, although other maintenance entities may be created and monitored as well. When the UNI is service multiplexed across more than one service instance, performance management on a link level basis is not feasible and must be done on a service level basis.  \\n       FIG. 5  illustrates an embodiment in which a single network operator provides service to connect User X&#39;s sites across a service provider&#39;s network.  FIG. 6  illustrates an embodiment in which more than one network operator provides connectivity to implement service provider Y&#39;s network. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 5 , to monitor connectivity between user X&#39;s sites, the user can use a UNI_C to UNI_C maintenance entity. This will allow end-to-end performance monitoring across the network.  \\n      Other aspects of the connection may be monitored as well. For example, it may be desirable to monitor the access links that connect the user X&#39;s sites to the service provider. Access link maintenance entities may be used for this. It may also be desirable to monitor flows through network operator A&#39;s network to monitor the performance within the network. This many be performed, as illustrated, through the use of intra-domain maintenance entities or with an UNI_N to UNI_N maintenance entity.  \\n      Where more than one network operator is used to provide connectivity in the service provider&#39;s network, each network operator will need to monitor performance within their own network as well as allow the service provider to monitor performance across the entire network. Thus, a UNI_N to UNI_N maintenance entity may be used to monitor performance across the service provider&#39;s network, an inter-domain maintenance entity may be used to monitor performance between two network operators, and intra-domain maintenance entities may be used by each of the network operators to monitor their own networks.  \\n      When multipoint flows are to be monitored, as shown in  FIG. 7 , additional maintenance entities of each type may be defined. For example, where the user has multiple flow points on each site, maintenance entities may be created to monitor flows between each of the customer flow points. Similarly, an access link maintenance entity may be defined for each customer flow point, and UNI_N to UNI_N maintenance entities may be defined between each of the network flow points. Depending on the topology of the interconnectivity of the networks, a single Ethernet link NNI may be used or multiple links may be used. Multiple intra-domain maintenance entities and one or more inter-domain maintenance entities may be required as well.  \\n      All of the maintenance entities defined on the network may be used to monitor performance. The invention is not limited to the particular illustrated maintenance entities as other maintenance entities may be defined as well.  \\n      Performance Parameters  \\n      Performance parameters for Ethernet networks may include several different parameters, and the invention is not limited to measurement of any particular group of parameters. Several parameters that may be measured include frame loss, frame delay, frame delay variation, and availability. While these parameters may be defined in different ways depending on the context, several possible uses for these parameters are set forth below. The invention is not limited to these particular parameters or to the manner in which these parameters are defined, as many different parameters may be created and used to manage the Ethernet domains.  \\n      One of the parameters that may be measured is a frame loss parameter, which may be measured as the difference between the number of service frames sent to an ingress UNI and the number of service frames received at an egress UNI. This may be applied to an Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVC), which corresponds to an UNI_N to UNI_N maintenance entity. In this context, for sub-rate or virtual services, the frame loss can be associated with both in-profile and out-of-profile service frames. In-profile service frames are those that are within the Committed Information Rate (CIR) for the particular service, and out-of-profile service frames are those that are transmitted in excess of the CIR for the service. Since the network elements on the network will typically handle in-profile traffic differently than out-of-profile traffic, frame loss may be measured for both types of transmissions.  \\n      Another parameter that may be measured is the frame delay. The frame delay may be measured as a round-trip delay, which is the amount of time which elapses between transmission of the first bit of a frame by the source node and reception of the last bit of a loop backed frame by the same source node, when the loop back is performed by the frame&#39;s destination node. Other forms of delay may be measured as well, such as on-way delay, and the invention is thus not limited to measurement of round-trip delay.  \\n      Another parameter that may be measured is the frame delay variation, which may be measured as a measure of the variation in the frame arrival pattern belonging to the same class of service instances compared to the arrival pattern at the ingress of the management entity node.  \\n      The availability function is a measure of the time the maintenance entity (associating service UNIs) is in available state. It is specified as a ratio of the total time a maintenance entity is in an available state divided by the total service time, where the total service time is viewed as a number of time intervals, and the available state is viewed as an interval when the service meets the frame loss, frame delay, and frame delay variation bounds. An unavailable state is encountered when at least one of the frame loss, frame delay, and frame delay variation parameters exceed their bounds/thresholds during a time interval. These bounds/thresholds are determined by the class of service. It may be noted that the definition of availability can also be based on the definition contained in ITU standard Y.1711, or in a number of other different ways.  \\n      Several additional performance parameters that may be taken into consideration include errored frame seconds, service status, and frame throughput. Errored frame seconds is a parameter that indicates if an error (e.g., frame error due to a Frame Check Sequence (FCS) or 8B/10B coding violation) has occurred within the second. This does not take into consideration errors when frames are received error free but are not delivered. The service status parameter indicates if the service is in-service or out-of-service. In-service or out-of-service state can be based on the available state mentioned above, and is available for both UNI-C to UNI-C and UNI-N to UNI-N maintenance entities. The frame throughput is an indication of the number of frames and/or bytes transmitted to a network interface relative to the committed information rate. Several other parameters may be measured as well, such as: \\n          Frame Tx\\u2014the number of frames transmitted out of the customer facing interface within the (previous) time interval (e.g. 1 second).     Frame Rx\\u2014the number of frames received from the customer facing interface within the (previous) time interval (e.g. 1 second).     Frame Drop\\u2014the number of frames dropped at the customer facing interface within the (previous) time interval (e.g. 1 second).     Loopback Status\\u2014this parameter indicates whether the customer facing interface is in an intrusive loopback state (potentially due to OAM interactions across access link maintenance entity).     Client Signal Fail\\u2014this parameter indicates the state of an access link maintenance entity.     Unavailable Time\\u2014indicates the number of time intervals (e.g. 1 second) when the service status is unavailable. \\n \\n Other parameters may be measured as well and the invention is not limited to these several identified measurements. \\n \\n Measurement Mechanisms \\n       \\n\\n      There are several different measurement mechanisms that may be used to make performance measurements, which may yield disparate measurements and exhibit different levels of accuracy. Several such mechanisms include management plane statistical methods, management plane managed object methods, and data path OAM frame methods.  \\n      The management plane statistical method uses OAM frames to estimate data path behavior. Such methods are the least accurate since they apply approximations to emulate data frames. The limitation lies in the fact that the behavior of actual data frames may be quite different due to different addressing, processing, transient congestion conditions etc. Also, error conditions in the networks typically happen in bursts, which are more likely to be underrepresented in a statistical model. Thus, the statistical methods are likely to represent different results not representative of actual traffic conditions, although statistical methods may be useful in particular contexts and the invention does not exclude the use of this measurement technique.  \\n      The management plane managed objects method uses OAM frames, which use data path managed objects to calculate performance parameters that are inserted and/or extracted via the management plane. These methods are fairly accurate since they use data path statistics to measure data path performance. Their limitation lies in the fact that since the insertion and extraction of these OAM frames is done via the management plane, in-flight frames need to be accounted for. On the egress side, in-flight frames refer to data frames sent in the time period between accessing the egress data path managed objects and actual transmission of an OAM frame relating to those objects. On the ingress side of an OAM frame, in-flight frames refer to data frames received between reception of an OAM frame and a subsequent access of the ingress data plane managed objects. However, this limitation can be addressed by averaging such measurements across multiple time intervals.  \\n      The data path OAM frames method uses OAM frames that use data path managed objects that are inserted and/or extracted via the data plane. This method tends to be the most accurate since it does not have the limitations associated with the in-flight frames described above with respect to the management plane managed objects technique. However, the current data path hardware/chips do not support the implementation of such methods, since this requires Ethernet data path processing to include automatic insertion and/or extraction of OAM frames with data plane managed object values. Moreover, it would also require changes in hardware/chips to allow ingress and egress filtering rules across OAM frames to protect service provider administrative domains from unintended OAM frames.  \\n      According to an embodiment of the invention, a measurement mechanism based on the use of management plane managed objects mechanism is used to measure network performance. One advantage of these mechanisms is that they require no changes in the existing hardware/chips of the installed base of network elements that ultimately will need to support the Ethernet OAM mechanisms described herein. Rather, such mechanisms only require changes to be made in the OAM client software to enable the Ethernet OAM performance measurement to be implemented. The invention is not limited to this embodiment, however, as one or more of the other described methods may be used as well.  \\n      In this method, measurement of a particular parameter may be accomplished via the collection of managed object information and calculation of performance parameter (s) from the collected managed object information. Each of these portions of the method will be described in greater detail below.  \\n      Performance Management Collection Method  \\n      Managed object information may be collected using general or specific methods. When a general method is used, it can be applied to collect information across different managed objects e.g. using type length values as information elements instead of specific information elements. However, when a specific method with specific information elements is used, a separate method is needed per managed object or per set of managed objects.  \\n      Similarly, it is possible to use either a solicited or an unsolicited collection method, in which a solicited method requires a response after an OAM request frame is sent, while an unsolicited method does not require a response to an OAM frame. Some current examples of solicited and unsolicited methods include loopback and continuity check, as described in greater detail herein, although the invention is not limited to these two examples.  \\n      A generic method similar to the variable request/response method used in IEEE 802.3ah may be used to send/receive data path managed object information. Further, according to an embodiment of the invention, both solicited and unsolicited methods may be used and optionally extended, as discussed in greater detail below. Note that this extension for performance management will require additional processing and therefore should not be used for the measurement of delay.  \\n      Frame Loss Measurement  \\n      Several maintenance entities may be defined to support frame loss measurements, including: service management entities for point-to-point service with dedicated UNIs; UNI_C to UNI_C; UNI_N to UNI_N; access link (UNI); inter-domain (NNI); network maintenance entities; intra-domain; inter-domain; and numerous other types of maintenance entities. The invention is not limited to the particular maintenance entities used to perform frame loss measurements.  \\n      Unsolicited Method  \\n      To calculate frame loss using an unsolicited method, when applied across a UNI_N to UNI_N management entity, an OAM frame is sent every N seconds (e.g. N=1) that includes an indication of the number of frames transmitted at the ingress service UNI. Upon receiving this OAM frame, the transmitted value is compared with a frames received value at the egress service UNI. Between two such consecutive OAM frames, the frame loss can be measured as Frame Loss=|CT2-CT1|\\u2212|CR2-C1|, where CT and CR are the number of transmitted and received frame counts, and the absolute value indicators apply where the counters wrap. The invention is not limited to the use of this particular formula, however, as other manners of measuring the frame loss may be used as well. Consecutive messages help in reducing error introduced by in-flight frames and any lack of timing synchronization between sender and receiver. Within a measurement time interval, the frame loss count can be averaged to improve the accuracy of this measurement.  \\n      Solicited Method  \\n      To calculate frame loss using a solicited method, the requestor sends an OAM request frame to a receiver every N seconds (e.g. N=1) with its managed objects information and expects an OAM response frame with receiver&#39;s managed object information. For example, when applied across an UNI_C to UNI_C maintenance entity, the requestor sends a frames transmitted value at an egress service UNI and requests a frames received value from the receiver&#39;s ingress service UNI. Similarly, when applied across an UNI_N to UNI_N maintenance entity, the requestor sends a frames received value at an ingress service UNI_N and requests the frames transmitted value from receiver&#39;s egress service UNI_N.  \\n      Upon receiving the OAM request frame, the receiver compares the received managed object information with its corresponding managed object information, and sends a response OAM frame back to the requester with the requested managed object information. When applied across an UNI_C to UNI_C maintenance entity, the receiver compares the received frames transmitted value with the frames received value and responds with its frames transmitted value. Similarly, when applied across an UNI_N to UNI_N maintenance entity, the receiver compares the received frames received value with its frames transmitted value and responds with its frames transmitted value.  \\n      Upon receiving an OAM response frame, the requestor compares the original sent value with the received values, in a manner similar to the receiver. It is possible that the receiver returns the results of frame loss instead of the managed object information in the response. However, if the managed object information is returned, the performance collection method remains generic.  \\n      Between two such consecutive OAM frames, the frame loss can be measured as Frame Loss=|CT2-CT1|\\u2212|CR2-CR1|, where CT and CR are the frames transmitted and frames received counts, and the absolute value indicators apply where the counters wrap. The invention is not limited to the use of this particular formula, however, as other manners of measuring the frame loss may be used as well. Consecutive messages help in reducing error introduced by in-flight frames and lack of timing synchronization between the sender and the receiver. Within a measurement time interval, the frame loss count can be averaged to improve the accuracy of this measurement.  \\n      Information elements that can be applied to the OAM data mentioned herein include the sequence number, the number of transmit TLVs (value filled in by requestor, recipient simply copies it back in response), the number of request TLVs (value is filled in by recipient and sent back in response), and the TLVs (Managed Object variable: FramesTransmittedOK &amp; FramesReceivedOK, value length, value). The above method can be applied for measuring network level frame loss. The network level frame loss can be measured within the network, independent of the services.  \\n      For non-dedicated point-to-point service types with multiplexed service UNI, where a UNI carries more than one service flow, it is possible to measure the frame loss when the data path managed objects per service instance are supported.  \\n      Statistical Method  \\n      For a multipoint-to-multipoint service type, the statistical method across a pair of UNIs can be applied to estimate frame loss. For example, the requestor may send a number (N) of OAM request frames to a recipient and may receive a different number (M) response frames back from the recipient such that M&lt;=N. The data path frame loss can be estimated as Frame Loss=(N\\u2212M) per measurement time interval. As noted earlier, statistical methods are less accurate than the solicited and unsolicited methods, but the invention is not limited to use of one of the solicited or unsolicited methods described above.  \\n      Frame Delay Measurement  \\n      Frame delay measurement may be performed for point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint between a given pair of UNIs. Service maintenance entities across which frame delay can be measured include UNI_C to UNI_C and UNI_N to UNI_N. Frame delay measurements may be performed using a solicited method such as loopback, an unsolicited method such as connectivity check, or another method:.  \\n      The loopback method measures round-trip or two-way frame delay. In this method, the requestor sends an OAM request message with its timestamp to the receiver. The receiver replies, copying the requestor&#39;s timestamp. At the requester, the difference between the timestamps at the time of receiving the OAM response frame and original timestamp in the OAM response frame results in round trip frame delay. The frame delay method may support several information elements, including sequence number and request timestamp. The invention is not limited to use of either of these OAM data fields.  \\n      Frame Delay Variation Measurement  \\n      The frame delay variation may be measured for point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint flows between a given pair of UNIs. The maintenance entities across which the frame delay variation can be measured include UNI_C to UNI_C and UNI_N to UNI_N. A solicited method, such as a loopback method, may be used. The loopback method measures the round-trip or two-way frame delay per request and response frame. Within the period of observation, the requestor keeps track of maximum frame delay (FD max ) and minimum frame delay (FD min ). The frame delay variation is then calculated as: frame delay variation or jitter=FD max \\u2212FD min . Information elements that may be used in connection with the frame delay variation include the sequence number and the request timestamp, although other elements may be included as well.  \\n      Additionally, one-way Frame Delay Variation (FDM) may be measured, for example at the receiver the frame delay variation may be measured as FDV=[Time(rx2)\\u2212Time(rx1)]\\u2212[Time(tx2)\\u2212Time(tx1)], to provide the one-way delay variation between the two samples. This does not require time synchronization between requestor and responder. The invention is not limited to this particular example as other measurements may be made as well.  \\n      Availability Measurement  \\n      Availability measurements may be performed for point-to-point services with at least dedicated UNIs. Service maintenance entities across which availability may be measured include UNI_C to UNI_C and UNI_N to UNI_N. Availability may be measured using one of the frame loss, frame delay, or frame delay variation methods described above. Since the availability time period may be different than the measurement time period, the availability time interval (e.g. 24 hr) can be divided into measurement time intervals (e.g. 1 minute). The frame loss, frame delay, and frame delay variation measurements are measured per measurement time interval. If any of the three measures crosses its corresponding thresholds, which are dependent on the service type, the measurement time interval is considered to be unavailable; otherwise it is considered to be available. The availability may be calculated as: Availability=(# of available measurement time intervals)/(# of total measurement time intervals)\\u00d7100%. Other details may be specified to define the availability as well, and other metrics may be developed to measure the availability, and the invention is not limited to this particular metric.  \\n      Other Measurements  \\n      A number of other measurements may be made as well. In the unsolicited method described above, these measurements may be made by sending OAM frames containing the information every time interval (e.g. 1 second) to the peer.  \\n      Available Management Objects  \\n      Some existing management objects that can be used for the mechanisms mentioned above include management objects specified in the following standards, although the invention is not limited in this manner as other management objects may be used as well: \\n          IEEE 802.3-2002 \\n            aFramesTransmittedOK     aFramesReceivedOK    \\n            IEEE 802.1Q-2003 \\n            Frames Received     Frames Outbound    \\n            RFC 3635\\u2014Ethernet-like interface MIB (Obsoletes 2665) \\n            IF-MIB     IfOutUCastPkts     IfOutMulticastPkts     IfOutBroadcastPkts     IfInUCastPkts     IfInMulticastPkts     ifInBroadcastPkts     aFramesTransmittedOK=ifOutUCastPkts+ifOutMulticastPkts+ifoutBroadcastPkts     aFramesReceivedOK=ifInUCastPkts+ifInMulticastPkts+ifInBroadcastPkts    \\n            RFC 2674\\u2014VLAN Bridge MIB \\n            dot1qPortVlanStatisticsTable     dot1qTpVlanPortInFrames     dot1qTpVlanPortOutFrames \\n \\n Part 3\\u2014Fault Detection and Verification \\n   \\n               \\n\\n      A method and apparatus for using OAM in an Ethernet network to perform fault detection is described in two Provisional U.S. Patent Applications: No. 60/518,920, filed Nov. 10,  2003 , and No. 60/518,919, filed Nov. 10, 2003. The content of each of these provisional applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference.  \\n      Part 3A\\u2014Fault Detection  \\n      Ethernet connectivity check can be applied to detect connectivity or continuity failures across a given pair of network elements. As used herein, the term \\u201cconnectivity\\u201d will be used to include the notion of \\u201ccontinuity\\u201d as these phrases maybe used interchangeably by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Connectivity failures could result due to hard or soft failures, with software failure, memory corruption, or misconfigurations being several examples of soft failures. When used in context of a specific service instance, connectivity check can be applied to detect connectivity failures across a given pair of network elements that support that common service instance. Although connectivity checks can be used to detect connectivity failures across any pair of network elements, it is particularly useful across a pair of edge network elements.  \\n      To detect connectivity failures with either a given set of network elements or all network elements meeting certain condition(s) within a boundary, a network element sends connectivity check frames to either a specific unicast DAs or to a multicast DA. Condition(s) associated with the frame could be that all edge network elements should receive this connectivity check or all edge network elements participating in a service instance should receive this connectivity check. Upon reception of the first connectivity check from a particular network element, the receiving network element identifies connectivity with sending network element and expects to receive further periodic connectivity checks. Once the receiving network element stops receiving periodic connectivity checks from the sending network element, it detects that connectivity to the sending network element is broken. Following detection of connectivity failure, the detecting network element may notify the operator or initiate fault verification, followed by an optional fault isolation step.  \\n      A connectivity check may be initiated either on-demand via an operator initiated action or may be performed periodically. The periodicity at which connectivity checks are performed may be configurable, although a default value such as a 10 second interval may also be established. Optionally, to prevent a dropped connectivity check frame from causing an unwarranted connectivity failure determination, a connectivity failure may require a larger number of sequential frame losses, such as three consecutive connectivity check losses.  \\n      Since the OAM connectivity check mechanism has a periodicity interval greater than 50 ms, it may not be suitable to detect and trigger a sub-50 ms failure detection and restoration operation. Accordingly, a supplemental detection mechanism such as an Alarm Indication Signal/Remote Defect Indication (AIS/RDI) may be used in conjunction with physical failure detection for sub-50 ms detection.  \\n      The receiving network element does not need to respond to a connectivity check. The use of multicast DA results in only O(n) messages, where n is number of network elements requiring connectivity failure detection among each other. In comparison, connectivity checks with unicast DA results in O(n 2 ) messages. When used between edge network elements, the multicast DA can be equal to \\u201cAll Edge Bridges Multicast DA,\\u201d which makes the connectivity check transparent to the interior network elements.  \\n      When used in context of a service instance, interior network elements which do not have any UNI for the service instance propagate connectivity checks to other network elements. Similarly, the connectivity check is blocked from going out on the UNI ports towards the customer. A connectivity check is processed by network elements that have a UNI for the service instance. It is possible that a network element may have a UNI for that service instance and also serve as an intermediate network element while connecting to other edge network elements, as shown by network element B in  FIG. 8 . Specifically, in  FIG. 8 , the network element B has a UNI interface as well as NNI interfaces connected to another edge network elements A, C, P which have UNI interfaces. In this case, the connectivity check is processed by this network element, while it is also propagated to other network elements.  \\n      Since the connectivity check relies on the existence of a frame rather than the content of the frame to indicate the presence of connectivity, the OAM data field of the generic frame format (described above) may be empty. Optionally, additional information may be conveyed in the connectivity check frames, and the invention is not limited to a particular implementation.  \\n      For example, assume that a network element is scheduled to be removed from service, or otherwise is about to become unable to participate in connectivity checks. Optionally, the network element may include its anticipated state in the data field of the connectivity check frames to convey this information to other network elements on the network. For example, if a network element is put out of commission, then to avoid triggering false failure detection, the out-of-commissioned network element may be configured to indicate its soon to be out-of-state status to other member network elements through a flag in the connectivity message. The other member network elements, upon receiving this indication, may deactivate a corresponding a heartbeat timer for that network element.  \\n      In the example illustrated in  FIG. 3 , assuming that A and F are customer network elements. B and C are edge network elements of provider X 1  and D and E are edge network element of provider X 2 . Both C and D are also edge hand-off network elements. Also assume there are other edge and interior network element in both provider X 1  and provider X 2  networks. A connectivity check can be generated at B (with a Unicast DA=MAC address on E) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ). This OAM frame will be forwarded to E based on its Unicast DA.  \\n      Alternatively, a connectivity check can be generated at B (with a Multicast DA=All Edge bridges Multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ). As a result, all edge network elements within the provider X 1  OAM domain will receive this connectivity check. When C receives this OAM frame, it will recognize it and processes it, as C is an edge network element. Since the OAM frame identifier=Segment inter-provider , C will also forward the connectivity check frame to D. When D receives this frame, it will recognize it and processes it. D will also forward the frame to all other edge network elements within the provider X 2  OAM domain. When this connectivity check frame reaches E, network element # will recognize the OAM Frame and processes it. However, since the OAM frame is not meant to be sent to the customer&#39;s network, network element E will terminate the connectivity check frame.  \\n      In another example, when a segment multicast OAM flow is needed within edge devices of provider X 1  network, it can be generated at B (with a Multicast DA=All Edge bridges Multicast DA) with an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider). As a result, all edge network elements within the provider X1 OAM domain will receive this connectivity check. When C receives the connectivity check, it will recognize it and processes it, as C is an edge network element. Since the OAM flow identifier=Segment   intra-provider , network element C will terminate the connectivity check and will not forward it to network element D.  \\n      Part 3B\\u2014Fault Verification  \\n      Once a fault is identified, it may be advantageous to verify the fault before taking corrective action or in connection with taking corrective action on the network. One way to do this, as described in greater detail below, is through the use of OAM loopback on the network.  \\n      Loopback causes a network element receiving a frame from a network element to transmit a corresponding frame back to the original network element. Loopback functions may be implemented on a network in two ways\\u2014using an intrusive loopback or using non-intrusive loopback. Intrusive loopback is used to place a remote network element in a continuous loopback such that all received frames would be looped back except OAM frames. Since this function results in loopback of data frames, the data path is impacted. Since the datapath is affected, this loopback mode is considered to be intrusive. Given the nature of this mode, it is expected to be used mainly for point-to-point functions. Intrusive loopback OAM frames, requesting start or termination of loopback, are expected to be unicast (with DA=address of remote network element). Moreover, the applicability of intrusive loopback is expected to be limited to Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services, although the invention is not limited in this manner. Intrusive loopback generally may be used for out-of-service testing or for other types of testing.  \\n      Non-intrusive loopback is used mainly to verify connectivity with remote network element(s) and may be used in both unicast and multicast scenarios. Non-intrusive loopback is performed by sending OAM frames to remote network element(s) and expecting a response back which verifies connectivity. Since the data frames are not looped back, and the data path is therefore not impacted, this loopback mode is considered to be non-intrusive. As a result, this function can be used for in-service testing.  \\n      Although non-intrusive loopback may be initiated at any time, it is particularly useful when verifying connectivity once a connectivity failure is detected, for example using the connectivity check functions described above. Non-intrusive loopback requests may be generated by a network element either automatically following detection of connectivity failure, where detection could be done using a connectivity check function, or on-demand via operator initiated commands.  \\n      Non-intrusive loopback may also be used for fault detection when used on a periodic basis. However, since non-intrusive loopback requires a response for each request, non-intrusive loopback response generation, and the handling of the response by requester, are more processing intensive tasks than connectivity check function described above, however.  \\n      Unicast Non-intrusive Loopback  \\n      In a unicast non-intrusive loopback request an OAM frame is sent to a particular network element (with DA=unicast MAC address of destination network element). Upon receipt of this request OAM frame, the destination network element responds back with one or more non-intrusive loopback response OAM frame(s) (with DA=unicast MAC address of requesting network element, which was learned from the request OAM frame). Other network elements that receive this request and/or response OAM frame forward the request and response OAM frames without processing them since the OAM frame DAs do not match the MAC addresses of the forwarding network elements.  \\n      With unicast non-intrusive loopback there is no need to provide an identifier in the request to relate a response OAM frame with a corresponding request OAM frame. Specifically, the network element that generated the request frame to the particular DA may wait for a response frame having a SA that is the same as the DA of the request frame. Thus, by matching request message DA with the response message SA, it is possible to use the response message source address to correlate response and request messages.  \\n      To make the non-intrusive loopback function meaningful, the requestor network element can maintain a timer to determine if a response OAM frame is received within an acceptable time period. When a response is not received within specified time period, the requester verifies connectivity failure. Following verification of connectivity failure, the verifying network element may notify the operator, and/or initiate an optional fault isolation step discussed below.  \\n      Although a unicast non-intrusive loopback can be used to verify connectivity failures across any pair of network elements, it is particularly useful across a pair of edge network elements. The invention is not limited in this manner, however.  \\n      Multicast Non-Intrusive Loopback  \\n      To perform multicast non-intrusive loopback, a multicast non-intrusive loopback request OAM frame is sent to all network elements meeting certain condition(s) within a boundary (with DA=Multicast DA). Several multicast DAs were discussed above in greater detail and may be used as the DA for the non-intrusive loopback frames. For example, the multicast request frame may be created so that all edge network elements should receive this request OAM frame or that all edge network elements participating in a service instance should receive this request OAM frame. Upon reception of a request OAM frame, the receiving network element(s) respond back with a unicast non-intrusive loopback response OAM frame (with DA=Unicast MAC address of requesting network element, which was learned from the request OAM frame). Other network elements that do not meet these conditions receive this request and/or response OAM frame and forward the frame without processing.  \\n      An identifier is not required to be included in the request to enable the requestor network element to relate a response OAM frame with a corresponding request OAM frame, although an identifier could optionally be used if desired. Where an identifier is used, the identifier may be used to detect the presence of loops on the network. Specifically, if the receiver receives an OAM frame with the same identifier, it may infer the presence of a loop on the network.  \\n      To enable the requestor to determine that a loopback has not occurred, the requestor network element can maintain a timer to enable the requestor to wait a predetermined allowable period of time during which it may expect to receive response OAM frame(s). Based on all the responses received within the specified time period, the requester discovers peer network elements. Similarly, to prevent the requesting network element from getting overwhelmed with response OAM frames arriving at the same time, a bounded randomized delay may be used by the responding network element (s). This randomized delay may be implemented in the responding network elements, for example, to cause them to delay a short period before responding with a reply. The bounded randomized delay, according to one embodiment of the invention, is bounded by the timer period set by the requestor to prevent the responses from being transmitted to the requestor outside the reception period at the requester.  \\n      Although a multicast non-intrusive loopback request OAM frame can be used to discover all network elements within an administrative boundary (with DA=all bridges multicast DA), it may be used according to one embodiment of the invention to discover all edge network elements within the administrative boundary. To do this, the requester will send a multicast non-intrusive loopback request OAM frame (with DA=all edge bridges multicast DA). The format for the OAM data field of the generic frame format may assume the data structure illustrated in  FIG. 9 , although the invention is not limited to this embodiment. Specifically, as shown in  FIG. 9 , the OAM data field in this embodiment includes a request/response ID, 4 bytes in length, to enable responses to be identified and correlated to the request that was issued to identify the network elements in the administrative domain.  \\n      Referring back to the example discussed above and illustrated in  FIG. 3 , assume that network elements A and F are customer network element, network elements B and C are edge network elements of provider X 1 , and network elements D and E are edge network element of provider X 2 . It will also be assumed that both C and D are edge hand-off network elements, and that there are other edge and interior network elements in both provider X 1  and provider X 2  networks.  \\n      A unicast non-intrusive loopback request can be generated at B (with a Unicast DA=MAC address on E) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ). This OAM frame gets forwarded to E based on its unicast DA. The request/response ID can be ignored in this case. Upon receiving the request, E sends a response back to B (with a unicast DA equal to the MAC address on B, which was learned from the request frame) with an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ).  \\n      Alternatively, a multicast non-intrusive loopback request can be generated at B (with a Multicast DA=all edge bridges multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ) and request/response ID (Id=XXX). As a result, all edge network elements within provider X 1  OAM domain receive this request. When C receives this OAM frame, it recognizes it and processes it, as C is an edge network element. Since identifier=Segment inter-provider , C also forwards this multicast non-intrusive loopback request to D. When D receives this request frame, it recognizes it and processes it. D also forwards this request frame to all other edge network elements within provider X 2  OAM domain. When this request frame reaches E, it recognizes it and processes it. However, since the OAM frame is not meant to be sent to the customer network, E terminates this request frame. Upon receiving the request, each edge network element sends a response back to B (with a Unicast DA equal to the MAC address on B, which was learned from the request frame) with an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ) and Request/Response Id (Id=XXX). A pre-configured randomized delay may be applied before the response is sent back to prevent too many responses from arriving at B at the same time.  \\n      Considering another case, in which a segment multicast OAM flow is needed within edge devices of the provider X 1  network. The OAM flow can be generated at B (with a multicast DA=all edge bridges multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ) and request/response ID (ID=XXX). As a result, all edge network elements within provider X 1 &#39;s OAM domain receive this request. When C receives request frame, it recognizes it and processes it, as C is an edge network element. Since the identifier=Segment intra-provider , C terminates the request and does not forwards it to D. The response behavior remains the same. Upon receiving the request, each edge network element sends a response back to B (with a unicast DA equal to the MAC address on B, which was learned from the request frame), with an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ), and request/response ID (ID=XXX). A pre-configured randomized delay may be applied before response is sent back as described above.  \\n      Using fault detection and fault verification, as described above, Ethernet OAM flows may be able to be used to identify faults on the network and verify the existence of the fault. Although specific techniques have been described herein, the invention is not limited to only these several described embodiments, as the fault detection and verification techniques may be used in other ways on the network as well.  \\n      Part 3C\\u2014Auto-Discovery Method for Ethernet Networks  \\n      Ethernet network topography may be discovered using either the unsolicited or solicited methods described above. For example, by using the connectivity check method described above, with Ethernet OAM frames addressed to one of the defined multicast DAs, Ethernet connectivity check may be used to perform network topography auto-discovery. Specifically, a multicast OAM flow within provider X 1  network may be generated at B (with a Multicast DA=All Edge bridges Multicast DA) with an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ). As a result, all edge network elements within the provider X 1  OAM domain will receive this connectivity check. When C receives the connectivity check, it will recognize it and processes it, as C is an edge network element. Since the OAM flow identifier=Segment intra-provider , network element C will terminate the connectivity check and will not forward it to network element D. By maintaining a table of network elements generating connectivity check frames, the network element can build a network topography map of the network.  \\n      Similarly, the loopback method (as described above) may be used to perform network topography discovery using a solicited auto-discovery method. For example, by generating multicast Ethernet OAM frames addressed to edge network elements, and collecting responses from those edge network elements, the a network topography may be built to show the edge network elements visible to the originating network element. Similarly, if the multicast DA is set to \\u201call bridges multicast DA\\u201d the topography of the interior of the domain may be determined as well.  \\n      For example, a multicast non-intrusive loopback request can be generated at B (with a Multicast DA=all edge bridges multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ) and request/response ID (Id=XXX). As a result, all edge network elements within provider X 1  OAM domain receive this request. When C receives this OAM frame, it recognizes it and processes it, as C is an edge network element. Since identifier=Segment inter-provider , C also forwards this multicast non-intrusive loopback request to D. When D receives this request frame, it recognizes it and processes it. D also forwards this request frame to all other edge network elements within provider X 2  OAM domain. When this request frame reaches E, it recognizes it and processes it. However, since the OAM frame is not meant to be sent to the customer network, E terminates this request frame. Upon receiving the request, each edge network element sends a response back to B (with a Unicast DA equal to the MAC address on B, which was learned from the request frame) with an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ) and Request/Response Id (Id=XXX). A pre-configured randomized delay may be applied before the response is sent back to prevent too many responses from arriving at B at the same time. By collecting the responses, the network topography may be determined by the network element. Where the interior of the network is of interest as well, the multicast DA may be set to all bridges multicast DA. A similar method may be used to determine the topography of a portion of the network, such as on a domain level, by setting the OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ). The invention is not limited to these several examples, however, as other methods may be used as well to perform network topography discovery.  \\n      Part 4\\u2014Fault Isolation  \\n      Once a fault is detected and optionally verified, it may be helpful for the network administrator to be able to isolate the fault isolation. Isolation of the fault allows the network operator to locate where on the network the fault is occurring, and identify which network element requires attention to minimize service interruption associated with repairing the fault. The process of fault isolation will be discussed in greater detail below, and is also described in Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60/518,912, filed Nov. 10, 2003, the content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.  \\n      According to an embodiment of the invention, a path trace function is used to trace the path traversed by a data frame between a source network element and a destination network element. The path trace function can be used in two ways: to find a path through the network under non-failure conditions, and to identify the location of a failure under other conditions. Under multiple failure scenarios, where multiple failures occur within the failure detection time, the path trace function can serve to localize the first occurrence of the failure along the path. As discussed below, the path trace function will not traverse a failure and, hence, cannot be used to identify the location of additional failures behind the first failure. Optionally, the path trace function may be used from both sides of a failure to confirm a single failure on the path or to locate two failures on the path.  \\n      Although a path trace function may be initiated at any time, it is particularly useful when localizing failures once a connectivity failure has been detected and optionally verified. The path trace request may be generated by a network element either automatically following detection and verification of connectivity failure, where detection could be done using the connectivity check function and verification could be done using one of the loopback functions, such as the unicast non-intrusive loopback function, both of which are described above. Alternatively, the path trace may be performed on-demand via an operator initiated command.  \\n      A path trace request OAM frame is sent to all network elements meeting certain condition(s) within a boundary (with the OAM frame DA=Multicast DA). Condition(s) could be that all network elements having certain knowledge of a particular destination address should receive this request OAM frame within a single provider network, with all such receiving network elements needing to respond, or that all network elements having certain knowledge of a particular destination address should receive this request OAM frame within multiple provider networks, but that only edge network elements need to respond. Other knowledge conditions may be used as well, and the invention is not limited to the particular knowledge conditions described herein.  \\n      Upon reception of a request OAM frame, the receiving network element responds back with a unicast path trace response OAM frame (with DA=unicast MAC address of requesting network element, as learned from the request OAM frame) and also attempts to forward the path trace request OAM frame to the next possible hop toward the destination address associated with the knowledge condition.  \\n      Since a single OAM request frame can generate multiple responses back to the requester, it is desirable to include an identifier in the request to enable the requester network element to correlate a response OAM frame with the corresponding request OAM frame that caused the response to be generated.  \\n      Since the requestor network element is expecting frames to be returned, the requester network element may maintain a timer to enable it to wait a predetermined period during which it may expect to receive response OAM frame(s). Based on all the responses received within the specified time period, the requester can determine the path to the desired network element or determine where, on the network, the path stops en-route to the desired network element. As discussed above in connection with multicast loopback section, a bounded randomized delay may be used by the responding network element(s) to delay generation of a response message to thereby prevent the requesting network element from getting overwhelmed with response OAM frames arriving at the same time.  \\n      The request OAM frame may be sent to all network elements (with DA=All bridges multicast DA). If the path trace is used within a single provider network domain, which is expected to be the general case, the request OAM frame may use an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ). On the other hand, if the path trace is to be used across multiple provider networks, which is generally not applicable since providers do not normally offer visibility within their network domains, the request OAM frame may use an OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ).  \\n      The path trace function may be used to determine a path to a particular network element, as well as to identify the location of a fault on a path to the network element.  FIG. 10  illustrates a possible data structure for a data field  74  of the OAM frame format illustrated in  FIG. 4  and described in greater detail above. This data field format may be used to implement the path trace function according to an embodiment of the invention, although the invention is not limited to an embodiment that implements this particular data structure.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 10 , the OAM data field includes request response ID  78  that may be used to identify responses to the request. The destination network element is identified using a target MAC address field  80 . Since intermediate receiving network elements may replicate the path trace request OAM frames, and thus the SA of packets used to perform the path trace will not necessarily have the same SA as the original request, identity regarding the original requesting network element is maintained in the source MAC address field  82  in the OAM data field. This allows the responding network elements to always send a response back to the original requesting network elements using response OAM frame (with DA=source MAC address).  \\n      The request OAM frame in this embodiment also contains a hop count field  84  to enable the requesting network element to correlate the distance of the responding network element from the requesting network element. The handling of this hop count field is described in greater detail below.  \\n      To handle intra-provider and inter-provider topology visibility concerns, as mentioned above, the receiving networks elements can process the frame as follows: If OAM flow identifier in the request is (identifier=Segment intra-provider ) and the network element has knowledge of the target MAC address, a response OAM frame is sent to the requesting network element. Also the receiving network element generates another path trace OAM request copying the target MAC address and source MAC address fields from the request OAM frame it had received and increments the hop count field. When the target MAC Address is the address on the receiving network element, it sends a response OAM frame and terminates the request OAM frame.  \\n      Alternatively, if the OAM flow identifier in the request is (identifier=Segment inter-provider ) and the network element has knowledge of the target MAC address and the network element is a edge network element, a response OAM frame is sent to the requesting network element. If the target MAC address is not an address on the receiving network element, it generates another path trace OAM request copying the target MAC address and source MAC address fields from the request OAM frame it had received and increments the hop count field. When the target MAC address is an address on the receiving network element, it sends a response OAM frame and terminates the request OAM frame.  \\n      Given that the path trace flow is different from that of a user data flow (since the path trace goes through the control plane of each hop; whereas, user data flow doesn&#39;t), there can exist rare situations where the failure cannot be detected by the path trace flow. Since the path trace can identify all the network elements along the traced path, it is possible to run loopback between the requesting node and the intermediate nodes to further isolate the connectivity failure in such rare situations.  \\n      Referring back to the example illustrated in  FIG. 3 , an inter-domain path trace request can be generated at B (with a multicast DA=all bridges multicast DA) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ), request/response Id (Id=XXX), target MAC address (address=MAC address of E), source MAC address (address=MAC address of B) and hop count (count=1). As a result, all network elements within provider X 1  OAM domain receive this request.  \\n      When C receives this OAM frame, it recognizes it and processes it, as it is an edge network element and has information on E&#39;s MAC address. C sends a response back to B (with a unicast DA=MAC address on B, as learned from the source MAC address) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ), request/response Id (Id=XXX), and the same values of target MAC address, source MAC address and hop Count. Since the identifier=Segment inter-provider , C also generates a similar path trace request to D with the same values from the request OAM frame it had received. However, the hop count is increment by 1 (hop count=2).  \\n      When D receives this request frame, it recognizes it and processes it. D also forwards this request frame to all other network elements within provider X 2  OAM domain. When this request frame reaches E, it recognizes it and processes it, as E is an edge network element and contains E&#39;s MAC address. E sends a response back to B (with a unicast DA=MAC address on B, as learned from the source MAC address) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment inter-provider ) request/response Id (Id=XXX), and same values of target MAC address, source MAC address and hop count. Since the frame is not meant to be sent to customer network, E terminates this request frame. In this scenario, if a network element receives the request OAM frame but is not an edge network element, it just forwards the received request OAM frame to other network elements downstream.  \\n      A segment path trace OAM flow may also be needed. In this event, an intra-domain path trace request can be generated at B (with a multicast DA=all bridges multicast DA), with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ), request/response Id (Id=XXX), target MAC Address (address=MAC address of C), source MAC address (address=MAC address of B), and hop count (count=1). As a result, all network elements within provider X 1  OAM domain receive this request.  \\n      When C receives this OAM frame, it recognizes it and processes it, as it is a network element and contains the target MAC address. C sends a response back to B (with a unicast DA=MAC address on B, as learned from the source MAC address) with OAM flow identifier (identifier=Segment intra-provider ), request/response Id (Id=XXX), and same values of target MAC address, source MAC address and hop count. Since the identifier=Segment intra-provider , C terminates the request and does not forward it to D.  \\n      Generally, MAC entry age-out timers are used to flush out any dormant MAC table entries. This age-out time period may impact the capability to perform a path trace, because the MAC address, corresponding to a target MAC address entry in the OAM frame, in the Forwarding Data Bases (FDB), may age out. This becomes an issue when a failure occurs, which is not recoverable by other mechanisms.  \\n      Thus, a path trace can be performed within two intervals: before the age out period, or after the age out interval. If the path trace is performed before the age out period expires, the path trace will return valid results. If path trace is performed after the age-out period expires, the path trace will be limited to the first network elements that have aged the MAC address out of their forwarding databases. It is possible that the path trace can be performed beyond the age out period by maintaining a view of the path at the edge network elements by performing periodic path trace during normal circumstances i.e. no fault conditions. Upon a failure in the network, the edge network element can use this path information to perform multiple unicast loopback where the DA for each consecutive unicast loopback request is the successive address contained in path information that is maintained at the edge network element. According to one embodiment of this invention, the periodicity of the periodic path trace is greater than the periodicity of the connectivity check.  \\n      The aspects of Ethernet OAM may be implemented in a number of different manners, including as software centrally instantiated in one or more management systems or as distributed code instantiated in the various network elements configured to implement the OAM functions. It should be understood that all functional statements made herein describing the functions to be performed by the methods of the invention may be performed by software programs implemented utilizing subroutines and other programming techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively, the aspects of Ethernet OAM may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or a combination of hardware, software, and firmware. The invention is thus not limited to a particular implementation.  \\n      When the OAM functions are implemented in software, the software may be implemented as a set of program instructions configured to operate in control logic on a network element that are stored in a computer readable memory within the network element and executed on a microprocessor. For example, in the network element of  FIG. 2 , the OAM functions may be performed by OAM module  46  implemented as software and executed on a processor associated with the interface manager  40 . However, in this embodiment as with the previous embodiments, it will be apparent to a skilled artisan that all logic described herein can be embodied using discrete components, integrated circuitry such as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), programmable logic used in conjunction with a programmable logic device such as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or microprocessor, or any other device including any combination thereof. Programmable logic can be fixed temporarily or permanently in a tangible medium such as a read-only memory chip, a computer memory, a disk, or other storage medium. Programmable logic can also be fixed in a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave, allowing the programmable logic to be transmitted over an interface such as a computer bus or communication network.

Field of the Invention  \\n      The present invention relates to a connector.  \\n      2. Description of the Related Art  \\n      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-45567 discloses a connector with first and second housings that can be connected together. The first housing has a lock arm and the second housing has a lock. The lock arm resiliently deforms and passes the lock in the process of connecting the two housings. The lock arm then returns resiliently to engage the lock when the two housings are connected properly.  \\n      The lock arm collides with the second housing during the resiliently restoration, and creates an audibly detectable snapping sound. The operator relies upon this audible snapping sound as indication of complete mating.  \\n      The resilient-restoring force of the lock arm is small. Thus, the lock arm collides with the second housing with a weak force and a soft collision sound. As a result, it is difficult for the operator to rely upon the collision sound to distinguish the connected state.  \\n      The invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to increase the sound volume of a collision as a lock arm is resiliently restored.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The invention relates to a connector with first and second housings. The first housing has a resiliently deformable lock arm, and the second housing has a lock. The lock arm interferes with the lock and deflects as the first and second housings are connected. The lock arm then is restored resiliently to engage the lock when the housings are connected properly. Thus, the first and second housings are locked together. At least one of the first and second housings has an oscillating portion for creating an aerial vibration in response to collision with the resiliently restored lock arm. A resonance space is provided for amplifying the collision sound of the lock arm and the oscillating portion.  \\n      The resonance space preferably is exposed at an outer surface of the connector when the housings are connected with each other. Thus, the collision sound resonated from the resonance space can efficiently reach the ears of an operator and will not stay inside the connector.  \\n      The oscillating portion preferably is continuous with the lock and is displaced resiliently by the resilient restoring force of the lock arm when the lock arm is deformed by interference with the lock. Thus, the oscillating portion is restored resiliently when the lock arm is restored. The amplitude of the aerial vibration created by the collision of the lock arm and the oscillating portion is large as compared to a case where only the lock arm is restored resiliently. Accordingly, the collision sound amplified by the resonance in the resonance space becomes louder.  \\n      An enclosed space preferably is defined at a side of the oscillating portion opposite from the resonance space, and more particularly between the oscillating portion and the lock arm when the lock arm is restored resiliently. The aerial vibration created by the oscillating portion resonates both in the resonance space and in the enclosed space. Thus, the collision sound is loud. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is a section showing a state where a first and a second housings are connected in one embodiment of the invention.  \\n       FIG. 2  is a front view of the first housing connected with the second housing.  \\n       FIG. 3  is a front view of the second housing.  \\n       FIG. 4  is a rear view of the second housing.  \\n       FIG. 5  is a section of the second housing.  \\n       FIG. 6  is a plan view of the second housing. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n      A connector according to the invention includes first and second housings  10  and  20 , as shown in FIGS.  1  to  6 . The first housing  10  is made of a synthetic resin and is transversely symmetrical. Cavities  11  are formed transversely side-by-side and penetrate the first housing  10  in forward and backward directions, and female terminal fittings  12  are accommodated in the respective cavities  11 . A lock arm  13  is formed integrally on the upper surface of the first housing  10  and extends longitudinally in forward and backward directions. The terms upper and lower are used herein to provide a convenient frame of reference, but are not intended to imply a required gravitational orientation The lock arm  13  has left and right side walls  14  and a coupling  15  that couples both sidewalls  14 . The left and right sidewalls  14  are narrow and long in forward and backward directions and have a vertically long rectangular lateral cross section. The bottom edges of both sidewalls  14  are narrow and long in forward and backward directions in an area extending from the rear ends of the sidewalls  14  (right ends in  FIG. 1 ) up to positions slightly before substantially longitudinal middles of the sidewalls  14 . An overhanging slanted surface  16  is formed at the front end of the coupling  15  and slopes up to the front to face down.  \\n      An engaging portion  17  couples upper areas of the front-ends of both sidewalls  14 . The front surface of the engaging portion  17  is continuous and flush with the front-end surfaces of both sidewalls  14 , and the upper surface of the engaging portion  17  is continuous and flush with the upper end surfaces of both sidewalls  14 . The lower surface of the engaging portion  17  is above the bottom end surfaces of both sidewalls  14 . Thus, a forwardly open recess  18  is formed in the front surface and the bottom surface of the lock arm  13 . Accordingly, the lock arm  13  is gate-shaped when viewed from the front.  \\n      The lower surfaces of the both sidewalls  14  are coupled to the upper surface of the first housing  10  by left and right legs  19  at a substantially longitudinal middle position of the lock arm  13  and behind the front end of the coupling  15 . The lock arm  13  is supported on the upper surface of the first housing  10  by these legs  19 . The sidewalls  14  are horizontal and parallel with the upper surface of the first housing  10  when the lock arm  13  is unbiased. However, the lock arm  13  can undergo a seesaw-like resilient deformation to displace the engaging portion  17  at the front end up substantially normal to a connecting direction of the housings  10 ,  20  with the legs  19  as supports.  \\n      The second housing  20  is made of a synthetic resin and is shaped transversely symmetrically to the first housing  10 . Cavities  21  are formed transversely side-by-side and penetrate the second housing  20  in forward and backward directions. Male terminal fittings  22  are accommodated in the respective cavities  21 . A receptacle  23  is formed at the front end of the second housing  20 . The receptacle  23  has an open front end and a wide elliptical cross section. Tabs  22   a  at the front ends of the male terminal fittings  22  project into the receptacle  23 . Part of the first housing  10  before the legs  19  fits in the receptacle  23  when the two housings  10 ,  20  are connected properly and a part of the lock arm  13  before the legs  19  is above the receptacle  23 .  \\n      An oscillating wall  24  is formed integrally with the flat upper wall of the receptacle  23  of the second housing  20 . The oscillating wall  24  is a flat and parallel with the upper surface of the upper wall, and opposite left and right side edges and the front end edge of oscillating portion  24  are coupled to the upper surface of the upper wall. A resonance space  25  is defined between the oscillating wall  24  and the upper wall of the receptacle  23 . The resonance space  25  has a vertical dimension smaller than its dimensions along forward and backward directions and its transverse directions. Additionally, the resonance space  25  opens only backward with a wide slit.  \\n      The oscillating wall  24  is slightly wider than spacing between the outer surfaces of the sidewalls  14  of the lock arm  13 . The front ends of the lower surfaces of the left and right sidewalls  14  of the lock arm  13  contact the rear end of the upper surface of the oscillating wall  24  or face it with a small clearance when the housings  10 ,  20  are connected properly, and the rear end of the upper surface of the oscillating wall  24  and the engaging portion  17  of the lock arm  13  are spaced vertically apart by the recess  18 .  \\n      A lock  26  projects up at a widthwise middle of the upper surface of the oscillating wall  24 . The upper surface of the lock  26  has a slanted guiding surface  27  that slopes down toward the front, and the bottom end of this slanted guiding surface  27  is continuous with the front end edge of the upper wall of the receptacle  23 . The rear of the lock  26  has an overhanging locking surface  28  that inclines slightly backward with respect vertical direction (direction normal to the connecting and separating directions of the two housings  10 ,  20 ). Further, the lock  26  is sufficiently narrower than spacing between the inner side surfaces of the resonance space  25  and slightly smaller than the space between the inner surfaces of the opposite sidewalls  14  of the lock arm  13 . A formation area of the lock  26  along forward and backward directions extends from the front end of the oscillating wall  24  to a position slightly behind a middle position thereof. Therefore, the lock  26  is located right above the resonance space  25 .  \\n      With the two housings  10 ,  20  properly connected, the slanted surface  16  of the lock arm  13  faces the front end of the slanted guiding surface  27  of the lock  26  while defining a small clearance thereto. Additionally, an upper area of the locking surface  28  faces the engaging portion  17  of the lock arm  13  from behind along forward and backward directions while being spaced apart. In other words, the lock  26  is between the front end of the coupling  15  of the lock arm  13  and the engaging portion  17  of the lock arm  13  between the left and right side walls  14 .  \\n      Upon connecting the two housings  10 ,  20 , the front end of the first housing  10  fits in the receptacle  23  of the second housing  20 . In the connection process, the engaging portion  17  at the front end of the lock arm  13  contacts the slanted guiding surface  27  of the lock  26 . The engaging portion  17  then moves onto the lock  26  while sliding on the slanted guiding surface  27 . As a result, the lock arm  13  is deformed resiliently to displace its front end up with the legs  19  as supports. A degree of the resilient deformation of the lock arm  13 , i.e. a resilient restoring force, reaches its maximum immediately before the two housings  10 ,  20  are connected properly and when the engaging portion  17  reaches the uppermost end of the lock  26 . As the lock arm  13  is deformed resiliently, the engaging portion  17  presses the lock  26  down due to the resilient restoring force of the lock arm  13 . Thus, the lock  26  and the oscillating wall  24  on which the lock  26  is formed are displaced slightly down together. At this time, the oscillating wall  24  undergoes a resilient deformation and curves. Further, the front ends of the left and right sidewalls  14  of the lock arm  13  are higher than the upper surface of the oscillating wall  24 .  \\n      The engaging portion  17  completely passes the lock  26  as the two housings  10 ,  20  become properly connected. Thus, the lock arm  13  is restored resiliently and displaces the engaging portion  17  and the front-ends of the sidewalls  14  down due to the resilient restoring force of the lock arm  13 . Simultaneously, the oscillating wall  24 , freed from the lock arm  13 , is restored resiliently from a curved state to a flat state due to its own resilient restoring force and displaces upward. As a result, the lower surfaces of the front ends of the sidewalls  14  of the lock arm  13  (portion of the lock arm  13  most distant from the supporting point of resilient deformation) and the upper surface of the oscillating wall  24  strongly collide with each other. This collision causes the oscillating wall  24  to vibrate, thereby creating an aerial vibration. The oscillating wall  24  forms the upper wall of the resonance space  25 . Thus, the vibration of the oscillating wall  24  vibrates the air in the resonance space  25 , and the aerial vibration resonates in the resonance space  25 . A collision sound created by the collision of the lock arm  13  and the oscillating wall  24  is amplified by this resonance and reaches the ears of an operator as a large collision sound.  \\n      An enclosed space  29  with an open back end-is defined when the lock arm  13  is restored resiliently. The enclosed space  29  is defined by the upper surface of the oscillating portion  24 , the recess  18  formed by the inner surfaces of the left and right sidewalls  14  and the lower surface of the engaging portion  17  at the front end of the lock arm  13 , and the locking surface  28  which is the front end surface of the lock  26 . The oscillating portion  24  forms the bottom wall of this enclosed space  29 . Thus, the air in the enclosed space  29  vibrates as the oscillating portion  24  vibrates and resonance also occurs in the enclosed space  29  similar to and substantially simultaneously with the resonance in the resonance space  25 . The collision sound of the lock arm  13  and the oscillating portion  24  reaches the ears of the operator after being amplified by the resonance action in this enclosed space  29 .  \\n      Further, with the two housings  10 ,  20  properly connected, the engaging portion  17  of the lock arm  13  is engaged with the locking surface  28  of the lock  26  to prevent the separation of the two housings  10 ,  20 . As a result, the housings  10 ,  20  are locked in their properly connected state. The two housings  10 ,  20  can be separated by pressing the rear end of the lock arm  13  down to resiliently deform the lock arm  13 . As a result, the engaging portion  17  moves to a position above the lock  26 . In this way, the lock arm  13  and the lock  26  disengage and the two housings  10 ,  20  may be pulled apart.  \\n      As described above, the second housing  20  has both the oscillating wall  24  for creating an aerial vibration by collision with the resiliently restored lock arm  13  and the resonance space  25  for causing the aerial vibration of the oscillating wall  24  to resonate. The aerial vibration created by the oscillating wall  24  upon the collision with the lock arm  13  resonates in the resonance space  25  when the lock arm  13  is restored to lock the housings  10 ,  20  together. The collision sound of the lock arm  13  and the oscillating wall  24  is amplified by this resonance, thereby increasing the volume of the collision sound created by the resilient restoration of the lock arm  13 . Therefore, the operator can judge whether the housings have been locked together based on the presence or absence of the collision sound.  \\n      The resonance space  25  is exposed backward at the outer surface of the second housing  20  when the two housings  10 ,  20  are connected together and no member that could block a resonance sound propagating backward from the resonance space  25  is present behind the resonance space  25 . Thus, the collision sound amplified by resonance in the resonance space  25  can efficiently reach the ears of the operator without staying in the connector.  \\n      With the lock arm  13  restored, the enclosed space  29  is defined on the side of the oscillating wall  24  opposite the resonance space  25  (i.e. position located above the resonance space  25  with the oscillating portion  24  located therebetween) between the oscillating wall  24  and the lock arm  13 . Thus, aerial vibration created by the oscillating wall  24  resonates both in the resonance space  25  and in the enclosed space  29  so that the collision sound is loud.  \\n      The enclosed space  29  is exposed backward similar to the resonance space  25  and no member that could block a resonance sound propagating backward from the enclosed space  29  is present behind the enclosed space  29 . Thus, the collision sound amplified by the resonance in the enclosed space  29  can also efficiently reach the ears of the operator.  \\n      The oscillating wall  24  and the lock  26  are continuous with each other, and the oscillating wall  24  is resiliently displaced by receiving the resilient restoring force of the lock arm  13  after the lock arm  13  is deformed due to the interference with the lock  26 . Accordingly, when the lock arm  13  is resiliently restored, the oscillating wall  24  also is also resiliently restored. Therefore, the amplitude of the aerial vibration created at the time of the collision of the lock arm  13  and the oscillating wall  24  is larger as compared to a case where only the lock arm  13  is resiliently restored, and the collision sound amplified by the resonance in the resonance space  25  becomes louder.  \\n      The invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiment is also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. Beside the following embodiment, various changes can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the claims.  \\n      The oscillating wall and the resonance space are provided only in the housing without the lock arm in the foregoing embodiment. However, they may be provided only in the housing formed with the lock arm or may be provided on both housings.  \\n      The resonance space is exposed at the outer surface of the connector with the two housings connected in the foregoing embodiment. However, the resonance space may be exposed at the inner surface of the connector according to the invention.  \\n      The resonance space is a dead-end space with only one open end in the foregoing embodiment. However, the resonance space may be a tunnel or a through hole with open ends.  \\n      The oscillating wall is displaced resiliently when the lock arm interferes with the lock in the foregoing embodiment. However, the oscillating wall may not displace when the lock arm is deformed according to the invention.  \\n      The end of the lock arm collides with the oscillating wall in the foregoing embodiment. However, a portion of the lock arm closer to the support of resilient deformation than the end may collide with the oscillating wall according to the invention.  \\n      The space at the opposite side of the resonance space is defined between the oscillating wall and the lock arm with the lock arm resiliently restored in the foregoing embodiment. However, no such space may be defined according to the invention.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005143585-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"The present invention relates to an improved synthesis of pyrrole capping group precursors.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"1 .

HCV is recognized as the causative agent for most cases of non-A, non-B hepatitis, with an estimated human sero-prevalence of 3% globally [A. Alberti et al., \\u201cNatural History of Hepatitis C,\\u201d  J. Hepatology,  31., (Suppl. 1), pp. 17-24 (1999)]. Nearly four million individuals may be infected in the United States alone [M. J. Alter et al., \\u201cThe Epidemiology of Viral Hepatitis in the United States,  Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am.,  23, pp. 437-455 (1994); M. J. Alter \\u201cHepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States,\\u201d  J. Hepatology,  31., (Suppl. 1), pp. 88-91 (1999)]. Unfortunately, there are no broadly effective treatments for the debilitating progression of chronic HCV.  \\n      There are not currently any satisfactory anti-HCV agents or treatments. Until recently, the only established therapy for HCV disease was interferon treatment. However, interferons have significant side effects [M. A. Wlaker et al., \\u201cHepatitis C Virus: An Overview of Current Approaches and Progress,\\u201d  DDT,  4, pp. 518-29 (1999); D. Moradpour et al., \\u201cCurrent and Evolving Therapies for Hepatitis C,\\u201d  Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.,  11, pp. 1199-1202 (1999); H. L. A. Janssen et al. \\u201cSuicide Associated with Alfa-Interferon Therapy for Chronic Viral Hepatitis,\\u201d  J. Hepatol.,  21, pp. 241-243 (1994); P. F. Renault et al., \\u201cSide Effects of Alpha Interferon,\\u201d  Seminars in Liver Disease,  9, pp. 273-277. (1989)] and induce long term remission in only a fraction (\\u02dc25%) of cases [O. Weiland, \\u201cInterferon Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection\\u201d,  FEMS Microbiol. Rev.,  14, pp. 279-288 (1994)]. Recent introductions of the pegylated forms of interferon (PEG-INTRON\\u00ae and PEGASYS\\u00ae) and the combination therapy of ribavirin and pegylated interferon (REBETROL\\u00ae) have resulted in only modest improvements in remission rates and only partial reductions in side effects. Moreover, the prospects for effective anti-HCV vaccines remain uncertain.  \\n      The HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins are presumed to provide the essential catalytic machinery for viral replication. The HCV NS3 serine protease and its associated cofactor, NS4A, helps process all of the viral enzymes, and is thus considered essential for viral replication. This processing appears to be analogous to that carried out by the human immunodeficiency virus aspartyl protease, which is also involved in viral enzyme processing HIV protease inhibitors, which inhibit viral protein processing are potent antiviral agents in man, indicating that interrupting this stage of the viral life cycle results in therapeutically active agents. Consequently it is an attractive target for drug discovery.  \\n      Protease inhibitors and many other compounds comprise N-terminal capping groups. Such N-terminal capping, or protecting, groups are not limited to HCV protease inhibitors. Any peptidyl biologically active compound may have an N-terminal capping group. Similarly, many non-peptidyl (particularly peptidyl mimetic) compounds comprise the equivalent of an N-terminal capping group. Furthermore, a primary or secondary amine in any compound could be derivatized with a capping group. Accordingly, N-terminal capping groups are widely used. There is therefore a need for N-terminal capping groups (sometimes referred to as protecting or protective groups) and methods for making such groups.  \\n      A pyrrole-based capping group that is particularly useful has been described (WO 03/087092). This capping group is relatively complex. A disadvantage of relatively complex capping groups is that they may not be readily available commercially and/or may be difficult to synthesize. As is known, carboxylic acids are convenient precursors for such capping groups. Unfortunately, there are no safe, efficient, and/or large-scale methods for synthesizing the carboxylic acid precursors corresponding to these particularly useful capping groups (see, D. T. Kozhich et al.,  Zh. Organ. Khimii,  16 pp. 849-855-750 (1980); UDC 547, 745: 312; A. J. Robinson et al.,  J. Org. Chem.  66, pp. 4148-4152 (2001); H. Falk et al.  Monatsh. Chemie,  104, pp. 925-923 (1973)).  \\n      Thus, there is a need for efficient synthetic routes to these carboxylic acid precursors of pyrrole-based capping groups.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The present invention relates to an improved synthesis of a pyrrole capping group. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n      This invention provides an improved synthesis of a carboxylic acid substituted pyrrole. Advantageously, this synthesis is amenable to large scale synthesis. Applicants&#39; invention allows for the capping group to be more readily available.  \\n      Accordingly to a one embodiment (A), this invention provides a process for preparing a compound:  \\n                 \\n          I-B, wherein:     each R is independently selected from an alkyl group; comprising;     a) reacting a compound of formula II-B:  \\n                 \\n    II-B, wherein each R is independently selected from an alkyl group, with a compound of formula III-B,  \\n                 \\n    in the presence of NaOt-Bu (sodium t-butoxide), an appropriate solvent (such as THF) at an appropriate temperature to provide a compound of formula IV-B:  \\n                 \\n       \\n\\n      An appropriate reaction temperature in any embodiment of the above reaction is about 20\\u00b0 C. or less. In one embodiment a solution of butanone and an appropriate solvent (such as THF) is cooled to about \\u22125\\u00b0 C. to about 15\\u00b0 C.

In  FIG. 1  is shown a sectional view of a silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment. Hereafter, the construction of the silicon carbide semiconductor device will be described based on this drawing.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 1 , the silicon carbide semiconductor device is provided with an N +  type substrate (substrate)  1  having an impurity concentration of, for example, 1\\u00d710 19  cm \\u22123  or more, an N \\u2212  type drift layer (first semiconductor layer)  2  having an impurity concentration of, for example, from 1\\u00d710 15  cm \\u22123  to 5\\u00d710 16  cm \\u22123 , a P +  type layer (second semiconductor layer)  3  having an impurity concentration of, for example, from 1\\u00d710 18  cm \\u22123  to 5\\u00d710 19  cm \\u22123 , and an N +  type layer (third semiconductor layer)  4  having an impurity concentration of, for example, from 1\\u00d710 18  cm \\u22123  to 5\\u00d710 20  cm \\u22121 . These N +  type substrate  1 , the N \\u2212  type drift layer  2 , the P +  type layer  3 , and the N +  type layer  4  are constructed of silicon carbide and a semiconductor substrate  5  is constructed of these substrate and layers.  \\n      A cell part having many J-FETs is formed in the semiconductor substrate  5 .  FIG. 1  corresponds to a sectional view to show a portion of the cell part.  \\n      A trench  6  passing through the N +  type layer  4  and the P +  type layer  3  and reaching the N +  type drift layer  2  is formed on the main surface side of the semiconductor substrate  5  in the cell part (region having J-FET formed therein). Although all of the trenches  6  are not shown in  FIG. 1 , in reality, these trenches  6  are formed in a state arranged at predetermined intervals at a plurality of positions. On the inner wall surface of each of the plurality of trenches  6  are sequentially formed an N \\u2212  epitaxial layer  7  that becomes a channel layer having a thickness of, for example, 1 \\u03bcm or less and an impurity concentration of, for example, from 5\\u00d710 15  cm \\u22123  to 5\\u00d710 16  cm \\u22123  and an P +  type layer (fifth semiconductor layer)  8  having an impurity concentration of, for example, from 1\\u00d710 18  cm \\u22123  to 5\\u00d710 20  cm \\u22123 .  \\n      In the J-FET, the first gate layer and the second gate layer are constructed of the P +  type layers  3 ,  8  and a source layer is constructed of the N +  type layer  4 . A gate wiring  10  and a source wiring  20  are formed on the top of the semiconductor substrate via an interlayer insulation film  9  formed over the surface of the semiconductor substrate  5 .  \\n      The gate wiring  10  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer and the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer. On the other hand, the source wiring  20  is electrically connected to the N +  type layer  4  forming the source layer. This source wiring  20  is so constructed as to be electrically separated from the gate wiring  10  via the interlayer insulation film  9 . The detailed layout construction of these gate wiring  10  and source wiring  20  will be described later.  \\n      A drain electrode  12  electrically connected to the N +  type substrate  1  is formed on the bottom surface side of the semiconductor substrate  5 . The cell part including the plurality of J-FETs is constructed by this construction. In this manner, a silicon carbide semiconductor device is provided with the cell part having the J-FETS.  \\n      Next, a partial sectional perspective layout of the silicon carbide semiconductor device shown in  FIG. 1  is shown in  FIG. 2 . The layout construction of the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  will be described based on this drawing. Here, a contact portion in contact with the gate wiring  10  of the P +  type layer  3  forming the second source layer and a contact portion in contact with a source of the N +  type layer  4  forming the source layer are shown in  FIG. 2  in the manner simplified in number, but in reality the contact portions are formed at a plurality of positions of each cell.  \\n      The gate wiring  10 , as shown in a region A in  FIG. 2 , is formed in such a way as to be put into contact with the surface of the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer and the surface of the P +  type layer  8  forming the second gate layer. To be more specific, although not shown in  FIG. 2 , contact holes are formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 1 ), and the gate wiring  10  and the P +  type layer  8  are electrically connected to each other via these contact holes. Further, as shown by dotted lines in  FIG. 2 , contact holes  4   a  are formed also in the N +  type source layer  4  by selective etching and the gate wiring  10  is buried in each of the contact holes  4   a  via an oxide film (insulation film)  13 , thereby being electrically connected to the P +  type layer  3 .  \\n      This gate wiring  10  is constructed of a Ni film, which is a material capable of being in ohmic contact with a P +  type semiconductor, and an alloy film laminated over the Ni film layer and made of Ni and Al.  \\n      As shown in the drawing, in the region where the plurality of J-FETs are formed of the cell part, the gate wiring  10  is constructed of a portion (first portion)  100  extended in the direction in which the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  are extended, that is, in the direction of length of these and portions (second portions)  101  extended in a direction normal to the portion  100 . The portions  101  are formed at a plurality of positions in the portion  100  and are so constructed as to be extended on both sides of the portion  100 . Further, the portion  100  is constructed of a Ni film having a width of, for example, about 3 \\u03bcm and an alloy film laminated over the Ni film and having a width of, for example, about 8 \\u03bcm and made of Ni and Al, and the portion  101  is constructed only of, for example, a Ni film. The width of the Ni film is equal to that of the trench  6  and is set at, for example, about 3 \\u03bcm. That is, a portion like the portion  100  where current passing through the respective P +  type layers  8  is collected to increase a current density is constructed of not only the Ni film but also the wide alloy film, and a portion like the portion  101  connected to each P +  type layer  8  is constructed of only the Ni film  103 .  \\n      The portions  100 ,  101  of this construction are provided in each cell. A plurality of contact holes each having a size of, for example, 1 \\u03bcm\\u00d71 \\u03bcm are formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 1 ) below the portions  100 ,  101 . Each portion  100  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  8  at a contact portion  8   a  and each portion  101  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  3  at a contact portion  3   a . In this manner, the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer and the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer of each cell are electrically connected to the outside through the gate wiring  10  and the electric potential of each gate layer can be controlled from the outside.  \\n      On the other hand, the source wiring  20 , as shown in a region B in  FIG. 2 , is formed in such a way as to be put into contact with the surface of the N +  type layer  4  forming the N +  type source layer. This source region  10  is constructed of an alloy layer made of Ni and Al that is a material capable of being in ohmic contact with the N type layer.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 2 , in the region where the plurality of J-FETS are formed of the cell part, the source wiring  20  is also constructed of a portion  200  extended in parallel to the direction of length of the trench  6  and the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer and portions  201  extended in a direction normal to the portion  200 . The portions  201  are formed at a plurality of positions in the portion  200  and are constructed in such a way as to be extended on both sides of the portion  200  at the respective positions. However, the portion  201  is formed on the one side of the portion  200  at the outermost position of the cell part.  \\n      Further, both of the portion  200  and the portion  201  are constructed of an alloy film made of Ni and Al and having a width of, for example, about 8 \\u03bcm. The portions  201  are arranged in such a way as to be embedded in the gap of the portions  101  in the gate wiring  10 .  \\n      The portions  200 ,  201  constructed in this manner are provided in each cell. A plurality of contact holes each having a size of, for example, 2 \\u03bcm\\u00d72 \\u03bcm are formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 1 ) below the respective portions  201  and each portion  201  is electrically connected to the N +  type layer  4  at a contact portion  4   b . In this manner, the N +  type layer  4  forming the source layers of the respective cells is electrically connected to the outside through the source wiring  20 .  \\n      In the silicon carbide semiconductor device constructed in this manner, the J-FET formed in the cell part is operated in a normally-off state. This operation is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate wiring  10  and a double gate driving is conducted as follows.  \\n      That is, the quantity of elongation of a depletion layer extending to the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  from both of the P +  type layers  3 ,  8 , which become the first and second gate layers, is controlled based on the electric potential of the gate wiring  10 . For example, when voltage is not applied to the gate wiring  10 , the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  is pinched off by the depletion layer extending from both of the P +  type layers  3 ,  8 . With this, the current passing between the source and the drain is cut off. When a normal bias is applied across the P +  type layers  3 ,  8  and the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7 , the quantity of elongation of the depletion layer extending to the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  is reduced. With this, a channel region is set and current is passed between the source and the drain.  \\n      As described above, in this embodiment, the layout construction of the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  has been shown in the double gate structure of controlling the electric potentials of the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers. According to this construction, a layout capable of preventing the cell from being enlarged in size can be constructed in the source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  in the silicon carbide semiconductor device having the J-FETs formed therein.  \\n     Second Embodiment  \\n      The second embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 3  is shown a layout, when viewed from the top, of the silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment. Further, the sizes of parts constructing the silicon carbide semiconductor device are shown in the drawing. The unit of these sizes is \\u03bcm although not shown in the drawing.  \\n      This embodiment is different from the first embodiment and shows an optimum layout of the gate wiring and the source wiring in the case of adopting a double gate structure for independently controlling the electric potentials of the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers. As for the other portions, this embodiment is the same in the construction of the silicon carbide semiconductor device as the first embodiment, so that descriptions will be here provided only on the different parts.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 3 , in the region where a plurality of J-FETs are formed of the cell part, the gate wiring  10  is constructed of a portion (first portion)  110  extended perpendicularly to a direction in which the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  are extended, that is, in the direction of length of these and portions (second portions)  111  extended in a direction normal to the portion  110  (in parallel to the direction of length). The portions  111  are formed at a plurality of positions in the portion  110  and are constructed in such a way as to be extended on both sides of the portion  110 . Further, the portion  110  is constructed of a Ni film  110   a  having a width of, for example, about 3 \\u03bcm and an alloy film  110   b  laminated over the Ni film  110   a  and having a width of, for example, about 8 \\u03bcm and made of Ni and Al. The portion  111  is constructed only of, for example, a Ni film  111   a . The width of the Ni film  111   a  is equal to the width of the trench  6  and is set at, for example, about 3 \\u03bcm. That is, a portion like the portion  110  where current passing through the respective P +  type layers  8  is collected to increase a current density is constructed of not only the Ni film  110   a  but also the wide alloy film  110   b  and a portion like the portion  111  connected to the each P +  type layer  8  is constructed only of the Ni film  111   a.    \\n      The portions  110 ,  111  of this construction are provided in each cell. A plurality of contact holes each having a size of, for example, 1 \\u03bcm\\u00d71 \\u03bcm are formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 1 ) below the portions  111  and each portion  111  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  8  at a contact portion  8   b.    \\n      Further, outside the region where the plurality of J-FETs are formed, the gate wiring  10  is constructed of a common line  112  extended in parallel to the portion  111  and having a width of about 8 \\u03bcm and a portion  114  formed over nearly the whole region below the first gate pad  113  and electrically connected to the common line  112 . The portion  110  of the gate wiring  10  provided in each cell is so constructed as to be extended to one side in the direction of length of the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  across the region where the plurality of J-FETs are formed and as to be connected to the common line  112 . For this reason, the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer of each cell is electrically connected to the first gate pad  113  through the portions  110 ,  111 , the common line  112 , and the portion  114  of the gate wiring  10 , and the electric potential of each gate layer can be controlled from the outside via the first gate pad  113 .  \\n      On the other hand, outside the region where the plurality of J-FETs are formed, the second gate pad  115  electrically connected to the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer is provided on the same side as the first gate pad  113  is provided for each cell. To be more specific, in this region, a contact hole is formed in such a way as to pass through the source layer  4  and the P +  type layer  3  is so constructed as to be put into direct contact with the second gate pad  115  via the contact hole.  \\n      In the region where the plurality of J-FETs are formed of the cell part, as shown in  FIG. 3 , the source wiring  20  is also constructed of a portion (third portion)  210  extended perpendicularly to the direction of length of the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  and a portion (fourth portion)  211  extended perpendicularly to the portion  210 . The portion  210  is formed at a position, for example, from 30 \\u03bcm to 40 \\u03bcm away from the portion  110  in the gate wiring  10 . The portions  211  are so constructed as to be formed at a plurality of positions in the portion  210  and to be extended on both sides of the portion  210  at the respective positions. However, at the outermost position of the cell part, the portions  211  are provided only on the one side of the portion  210 .  \\n      Further, both of the portion  210  and the portions  211  are constructed of an alloy film made of Ni and Al and having a width of, for example, about 8 \\u03bcm. The portions  211  are so constructed as to be embedded in the gap between the portions  111  of the gate wiring  10 . To be more specific, the distance from the portion  210  to the tip position of the portion  111  of the gate wiring  10  is set, for example, at about 2 \\u03bcm. Further, the distance from the tip position of the portion  211  to the portion  110  of the gate wiring  10  is set, for example, at about 4 \\u03bcm and the interval between the each portion  211  and the portion  111  of the gate wiring  10  is set at, for example, about 2 \\u03bcm. The portions  210 ,  211  constructed in this manner are provided in each cell. A plurality of contact holes each having a size of, for example, 2 \\u03bcm\\u00d72 \\u03bcm are formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 1 ) below the portions  211  and each portion  211  is electrically connected to the N +  type layer  4  at a contact portion  4   b.    \\n      Further, outside the region where the plurality of J-FETs are formed, the source wiring  20  is constructed of a source pad  212  extended in parallel to the portion  211 . The portion  210  of the source wiring  20  provided in each cell is so constructed as to be extended to the opposite side in the direction of length of the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  across the region where the plurality of J-FETs are formed, in other words, to the opposite side of the gate pad  113  and as to be connected to the source pad  212 . For this reason, the N +  type layer  4  forming the source layer of each cell is electrically connected to the source pad  212  through the portions  210 ,  211  in the source wiring and is electrically connected to the outside via the source pad  212 .  \\n      As described above, in the double gate structure of independently controlling the electric potentials of the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers, the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  can be laid out in the manner shown in this embodiment. With this, a layout capable of preventing the cell from being enlarged in size can be constructed in the source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  in the silicon carbide semiconductor device having the J-FETS formed therein.  \\n     Third Embodiment  \\n      The third embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 4  is shown a layout, when viewed from the top, of the silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment. This embodiment shows an optimum layout of the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  in the case of adopting the double gate structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential, as is the case with the first embodiment. As for the other portions, this embodiment is the same in the construction of the silicon carbide semiconductor device as the first embodiment and is nearly the same also in the layout construction as the first embodiment, so that descriptions will be provided only on the different parts from the first embodiment.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 4 , in this embodiment, a plurality of contact holes each having a size of 1 \\u03bcm\\u00d71 \\u03bcm are formed in the interlayer insulation layer  9  (see  FIG. 1 ) and the N +  type layer  4  below the portion  110  extended perpendicularly to the direction of length of the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  of the gate wiring  10  and the each portion  110  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  3  at the contact portion  3   a.    \\n      The whole region of the common line  112  shown in the third embodiment is made a gate pad  113 .  \\n      In this manner, in the double gate structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential, the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  can be laid out in the manner of this embodiment. With this, a layout capable of preventing the cell from being enlarged in size can be constructed in the source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  in the silicon carbide semiconductor device having the J-FETs formed therein.  \\n     Fourth Embodiment  \\n      The fourth embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 5  is shown a layout, when viewed from the top, of the silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment. This embodiment, as is the case with the second embodiment, shows an optimum layout of the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  in the case of adopting the double gate structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential. As for the other portions, this embodiment is the same in the construction of the silicon carbide semiconductor device as the third embodiment, so that descriptions will be provided only on the different parts.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 5 , in this embodiment, the portion  211  extended in parallel to the direction of length of the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  is formed at a position of a shorter distance from the trench  6  than in the second embodiment, for example, at a position of 1 \\u03bcm. Further, the distance from the tip of this portion  211  to the portion  110  in the gate wiring  10  is also shorter than in the second embodiment, for example, 2 \\u03bcm. The portion  211  extending in parallel to the direction of length of the trench  6  and the first gate layer  8  of the source wiring  20  is constructed of a Ni film.  \\n      In this manner, in the case where the portion  211  in the source wiring  20  is formed at a position close to the portion  110  in the gate wiring  10 , when the portion  211  is constructed of the Ni film, it is also possible to respond to a finer cell.  \\n     Fifth Embodiment  \\n      The fifth embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 6  is shown a layout, when viewed from the top, of the silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment. In this embodiment, as in the case with the third embodiment, the portion  211  of the source wiring  20  in the layout shown in the fourth embodiment is formed in the case of adopting the double gate structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential.  \\n      In this manner, even when the portion  211  in the source wiring  20  is formed at a position close to the portion  110  in the gate wiring  10 , each portion  110  in the gate wiring  10  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer at the contact portion  3   a.    \\n     Sixth Embodiment  \\n      The sixth embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 7  is shown a partial sectional perspective layout of a silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment.  \\n      This embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the contact hole  4   a  formed in the N +  type layer  4  by selective etching is formed in such a way as to be removed to a portion below the portion  101  in the gate wiring  10  of the N \\u2212  epitaxial layer  7 . That is, the contact hole  4   a  is formed in a size larger than in the first embodiment to enlarge the area of a portion buried in the oxide film  13  on the surface of the contact hole  4   a  of the gate wiring  10  to enlarge the contact area between the gate wiring  10  and the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer. This construction reduces the contact resistance between the gate wiring  10  and the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer and hence can reduce the ON resistance of the silicon carbide semiconductor device.  \\n     Seventh Embodiment  \\n      The seventh embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 8  is shown a partial sectional perspective layout of a silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment.  \\n      This embodiment adopts a multilayer wiring structure to reduce the size of the cell further than the first embodiment.  \\n      To be more specific, the trenches  6  are formed at shorter pitches than in the first embodiment. Further, the contact portion  4   b  of the source wiring  20  in the N +  type layer  4  forming the source layer and the contact portion  3   a  of the gate wiring  10  in the P+ type layer  3  forming the second gate layer are arranged in a line between the trenches  6 .  \\n      The source wiring  20  has a layout in which the portions  200  and the portions  201  are combined in the shape of mesh in such a way that the contact portions  4   b  of the same line arranged between the trenches  6  are connected to each other and that the contact portions  4   b  are connected to the contact portions  4   b  of the neighboring line. Further, the gate wiring  10  also has a layout in which the portions  100  and the portions  101  are combined in the shape of mesh in such a way that the contact portions  8   a  of the P+ type layer  8  in the same trench  6  are connected to each other and that the contact portions  8   a  are connected to the contact portions  3   a  of the P +  type layer  3  in the neighboring line. These source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  are constructed as separate layers and are electrically insulated from each other via an interlayer insulation layer (not shown).  \\n      In this manner, in the case of adopting the double structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential, the cell can be further reduced in size by forming the source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  in the multilayer wiring structure.  \\n     Eighth Embodiment  \\n      The eighth embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 9  is shown a partial sectional perspective layout of a silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment.  \\n      This embodiment also adopts the multilayer wiring structure to reduce the size of the cell further than the first embodiment.  \\n      In this embodiment, the electric connection between the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer and the gate wiring  10  and the electric connection between the N +  type layer  3  forming the source layer and the source wiring  20  are changed from those in the first embodiment. The other points are the same as in the first embodiment.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 9 , in this embodiment, the N +  type layer  4  and the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  between the P +  type layers  8  arranged between the neighboring trenches  6  are removed at a portion located at the contact portion  3   a  electrically connected to the gate wiring  10  of the P +  type layer  3 .  \\n      As shown in the region A in the drawing, the gate wiring  10  is laid out in the shape of mesh in such a way that the contact portions  8   a  of the P +  type layer  8  in the same trench  6  are connected to each other and that the contact portions  8   a  are connected to the contact portions  3   a  of the P +  type layer  3  in the neighboring line. The gate wiring  10  is arranged on the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 1 ) formed over the surface of the semiconductor substrate  5  and is connected to the P +  type layer  3  through the contact portion  3   a  via the contact hole formed in the interlayer insulation film  9 , thereby being connected to the P +  type layer  8  via the contact portion  8   a.    \\n      Further, as shown in the region B in the drawing, the source wiring  20  is laid out in the shape of stripe in such a way that the contact portions  4   b  of the N +  type layer  4  sandwiched between the neighboring trenches  6  and forming the source layer are connected to each other. The source wiring  20  is arranged on an interlayer insulation film (not shown) formed over the surface of the gate wiring  10  and is connected to the N +  type layer  4  through the contact portions  4   b  via the contact holes formed in the interlayer insulation film.  \\n      In this manner, in the case of adopting the double gate structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential, when the source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  are formed in the multilayer wiring structure, the intervals between the trenches  6  can be made narrower than in the first embodiment and hence the cell can be further reduced in size.  \\n     Ninth Embodiment  \\n      The ninth embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 10  is shown a partial sectional perspective layout of a silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment.  \\n      This embodiment also adopts the multilayer wiring structure to reduce the size of the cell further than the first embodiment.  \\n      This embodiment is constructed in such a way that trenches are formed perpendicularly to the direction of length of the trenches  6  and the P +  type layer  8  at a portion located at the contact portion  3   a  of the P +  type layer  3  where the gate wiring  10  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  3  and that the trenches are depressed as a whole. For this reason, the contact portions  8   a  of the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer with the gate wiring  10  are so constructed as to be alternately changed in height.  \\n      The other construction is the same as in the eighth embodiment and the gate wiring  10  is laid out in the shape of mesh and the source wiring  20  is laid out in the shape of stripe.  \\n      In this manner, in the case of adopting the double gate structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential, when the source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  are formed in the multilayer wiring structure, the intervals between the trenches  6  can be made narrower than in the first embodiment and hence the cell can be further reduced in size.  \\n     Tenth Embodiment  \\n      The tenth embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 11  is shown a partial sectional perspective layout of a silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment.  \\n      In this embodiment, P type impurities such as B or Al are ion implanted into a portion of the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7 , to be more specific, a portion that is not made a channel region to connect the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer to the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer by a P +  type layer (ion implanted layer)  30 .  \\n      That is, while the contact portions  4   b  are arranged in a line in the N +  type layer  4  sandwiched between the neighboring trenches  6 , all of the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  opposed to the contact portions  4   b  do not need to be made to function as a channel layer. For this reason, when a portion opposed to the contact portion  4   b  arranged at a position nearest to the tip in the direction of length of the trench  6  of the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  is made to function as the channel layer, a portion opposed to the contact portion  4   b  adjacent to the portion does not need to be made to function as the channel layer.  \\n      Hence, for example, when the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  of portions opposed to every other contact portion  4   b  or every several contact portions  4   b  are prevented from functioning as the channel layer and P type impurities are ion implanted into the portions, the P +  type layer  8  is connected to the P +  type layer  3  by the P +  type layer  30 .  \\n      With this construction, as shown in the region A and the region B in the drawing, it is possible to provide a simple layout in the shape of stripe in which the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  are arranged in parallel to the P +  type layer  8  and the N +  type layer  5 . Further, even if the multilayer wiring structure is not used, the intervals of the trenches  6  can be made narrower than those in the first embodiment to further reduce the size of the cell.  \\n      In this manner, with this construction of this embodiment, in the case of adopting the double gate structure for controlling the P +  type layer  8  and the P +  type layer  3  that become the first and second gate layers at the same electric potential, the cell can be reduced in size.  \\n     Eleventh Embodiment  \\n      The eleventh embodiment of the invention will be described. In  FIG. 12  is shown a partial sectional perspective layout of a silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment.  \\n      In this embodiment, as is the case with the tenth embodiment, in the portion that is not made the channel region of the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7 , the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer is connected to the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer. However, this embodiment is different from the tenth embodiment in that the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  and the N +  type layer  4  are not formed above the P +  type layer  30 .  \\n      That is, in the tenth embodiment, as shown in  FIG. 11 , ions are implanted into the surfaces of the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  7  and the N +  type layer  4  located above the P +  type layer  3  to form the P +  type layer  30 . However, in this embodiment, these layers are removed and then ions are implanted to form the P +  type layer  30 . This embodiment is the same in the other points as the tenth embodiment.  \\n      The construction of this embodiment can also reduce the size of the cell. According to the manufacturing process of this embodiment, even if ions are not implanted deeply, the P +  type layer  30  can be formed and hence an ion implantation device of high energy is not required to form the P +  type layer  30 .  \\n     Twelfth Embodiment  \\n      While a case where the gate wiring  10  is formed in parallel to the P +  type layer  8  and where the source wiring  20  is formed in parallel to the N +  type layer  4  has been described as an example in the tenth embodiment and the eleventh embodiment, the gate wiring  10  and the source wiring  20  do not necessarily need to be formed in parallel. The layout construction in this case will be described with reference to  FIG. 13  and  FIGS. 14A-14D .  \\n       FIG. 13  shows the whole layout construction of a silicon carbide semiconductor in this embodiment. Further,  FIGS. 14A and 14D  are partial enlarged views of the regions XIVA, XIVB in  FIG. 13 , respectively, and  FIGS. 14C and 14D  correspond to a sectional view taken on a line XIVC-XIVC and a sectional view taken on a line XIVD-XIVD in  FIG. 13 , respectively.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 13 , the silicon carbide semiconductor is constructed nearly in the shape of a square and a source pad  40  is arranged on one side and a gate pad  50  to which the P +  type layers  8 ,  3  that become the first and second gate layers are connected is arranged on one end of the side opposite to the source pad  40 .  \\n      The source wiring  20  and the gate wiring  10  constructed of a Ni film and an alloy layer made of Ni and Al are formed below the source pad  40  and the gate pad  50  via the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 14C ).  \\n      The source wiring  20  is constructed of a portion  220  extended to nearly the whole region below the source pad  40  and four lines  221  extended from the portion  220  perpendicularly to the direction of length of the source pad  40 .  \\n      In the cell part, as shown in  FIG. 14A , the contact portions  4   b  of the N +  type layer  4  forming the source layer are formed between the trenches  6  perpendicularly to the direction of length of the respective lines  221  in this source wiring  20 . In other words, in the portions to become this contact portions  4   b , contact holes are formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIG. 14C ), whereby the source wiring  20  is electrically connected to the N +  type layer  4 .  \\n      Further, the gate wiring  10  is constructed of a portion  120  extended to nearly the whole region below the gate pad  50 , three inner lines  121  extended between four lines  221 , and an outer peripheral line  122  constructed in such a way as to surround the periphery of the source wiring  20 .  \\n      In the cell part, as shown in  FIG. 14A , the P +  type layer  30  is formed by ion implantation in such a way as to overlap the respective inner lines  121  below the respective inner lines  121  in this gate wiring  10 . The center line of this P +  type layer  30  is made a contact portion  30   a . In other words, in the portion to be made this contact portion  30   a , a contact hole is formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  and the gate wiring  10  is electrically connected to the P +  type layer  30 . In this manner, the gate wiring  10  is electrically connected the P +  type layers  8 ,  3  that form the gate wirings.  \\n      On the other hand, in the outer peripheral region, as shown in  FIG. 14B , the trench  6  is laid out in such a way as to overlap the outer peripheral line  122  in the gate wiring  10 . Contact holes are formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  in this tip position and the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer is connected to the outer peripheral line  122  at the contact portions  8   a . Further, a trench  4   c  is formed in the N +  type layer  4  at a position overlapping the region located closer to the outer periphery of the cell part than the trench  6  of the outer peripheral line  122  and the outer peripheral line  122  is connected to the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer through this trench  4   c.    \\n      Further, as shown in  FIG. 14C , the gate pad  50  is formed in the opening of a protection film  61  formed over the surface of the interlayer insulation film  9  including the gate wiring  10 . In the region where this gate pad  50  is formed, the trench  6  is extended from the cell part and the P +  type layer  8  is formed therein just as with the cell part. Below the gate pad  50 , the N +  type layer  4  is removed and a contact portion  60  formed by ion implantation is formed on the surface portions of the P +  type layer  3  and the P +  type layer  8 , whereby the P +  type layer  3  and the P +  type layer  8  are electrically connected to the gate wiring  10 .  \\n      In this regard, in the outer peripheral region, a trench  62  formed by the same process as the trench  6  is formed in such a way as to surround the cell part and this trench  62  and the N \\u2212  type epitaxial layer  63  formed on the inner wall surface of the trench  62  realizes insulating separation.  \\n      As described above, this embodiment has a layout construction in which the gate wiring  10  is formed perpendicularly to the P +  type layer  8  and in which the source wiring  20  is formed perpendicularly to the N +  type layer  4 . This construction can produce the same effect as the first embodiment.  \\n     Thirteenth Embodiment  \\n      In the twelfth embodiment, one example of layout of the silicon carbide semiconductor device of the double gate structure for controlling the first gate layer and the second gate layer at the same electric potential has been described. However, in this embodiment, a double gate structure is capable of controlling the electric potential of the first gate layer independently from the electric potential of the second gate layer.  \\n      In  FIG. 15  is shown a partial sectional perspective view of the silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment. As shown in this drawing, only the gate wiring  10  (region A) connected to the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer and the source wiring  20  (region B) connected to the N +  type layer  4  forming the source layer are formed in the cell part. In the silicon carbide semiconductor device of this construction, a gate pad (second gate pad) for the second gate layer is formed at a position separate from the cell part.  \\n      In  FIG. 16  is shown the general layout construction of the silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment. Further, partial enlarged views of regions XVIIA, XVIIB in  FIG. 16  are shown in  FIGS. 17A, 17B , and sectional views taken on a line XVIIC-XVIIC and a line XVIID-XVIID in  FIG. 16  are shown in  FIGS. 17C, 17D . Hereafter, the construction of the silicon carbide semiconductor device in this embodiment will be described based on these drawings. However, this embodiment has nearly the same construction as the twelfth embodiment, so that descriptions will be given on the different portions between the embodiments.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 16 , in this embodiment, a gate pad  50  to which the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer is connected and a gate pad  70  to which the P +  type layer  3  forming the second gate layer is connected are arranged in such a way as to be adjacent to each other at the positions of the tips of two lines arranged inside the inner lines  221  in the source wiring  20 .  \\n      The gate wiring  10  constructed of the Ni film and the alloy layer made of Ni and Al is formed below the gate pad  50  via the interlayer insulation film  9  (see  FIGS. 17C, 17D ). This embodiment is constructed in the same manner as the twelfth embodiment except that this gate wiring  10  is electrically separated from the gate pad  70  and is not connected to the P +  type layer  3 .  \\n      Further, a gate wiring  71  is formed below the gate pad  70  via the interlayer insulation film  9 . This gate wiring  71  is constructed of a portion extended over the whole region below the gate pad  70  and an outer peripheral line  73  constructed in such a way as to surround the outer peripheral line  122  in the gate wiring  10 .  \\n      The gate wiring  10  is connected to the P +  type layer  8  forming the first gate layer in the cell part. To be more specific, as shown in  FIG. 17A , a region overlapping the inner line  121  in the gate wiring  10  of the P +  type layer  8  in each trench  6  is made the contact portion  8   a . In other words, at the position that is made this contact portion  8   a , a contact hole is formed in the interlayer insulation film  9  and the gate wiring  10  is electrically connected to the P+ type layer  8 .  \\n      In this manner, this embodiment has the above-described construction in the double gate structure capable of controlling the electric potential of the first gate layer independently of the electric potential of the second gate layer. This construction can also produce the same effect as the first embodiment.  \\n     Other Embodiment  \\n      In the above embodiments, the descriptions on the silicon carbide semiconductor device have been provided in which the first conduction type and the second conduction type are the N type and the P type, respectively.

Field of the Invention  \\n      The present invention relates to a method for refreshing and/or disinfecting ambient or forced air streams. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a base unit that contains removable cartridges for scenting or disinfecting air streams or ambient air wherein a fragrance, a disinfectant, or other functional liquid is atomized with the amount of scent dispersal controlled manually by preferences of the user.  \\n      Moreover, in the present context, the term \\u201cfreshening\\u201d means either scenting, disinfecting, or scenting and disinfecting, such as for an air stream or ambient air.  \\n      2. Description of Related Art  \\n      Scenting of ambient air, air streams, and scenting of air in all spaces has been the subject of much discussion, prior invention, and prior art. All animals and organisms \\u201cbreathe\\u201d in various ways, thus the quality of air can be critical. There are environmental, biological, and industrial illnesses of all types that are airborne and can be treated with atomized solutions. Further, even when air is adequately healthy to breathe, there can still be smells and scents that are very unpleasant and uncomfortable. Aroma therapists have demonstrated that these smells, or lack thereof, can have an impact on many aspects of human performance even though biological problems from infected air may not be present. The smell, freshness, and specific aromas of air can effect human mood, emotions, sleep, work performance, relaxation and sensuality. This invention addresses these and other issues with an effective, inexpensive, and simple to operate scent delivery system to freshen any air environment.  \\n      To address the problems of smell inherent to re-circulating air, the air-conditioning system has been investigated in the past as a means of introducing scents into the air stream thus treating both the forced and ambient air. A system fitting this description is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,044,276 to Kauten. Further, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,114, Ward discloses a scented air filter. Fragrant rods within the padding emit scent as air passes over them but if the fragrance is depleted, the entire filter itself must be replaced at a substantial expense. This expense for freshening must be incurred even if the filter itself is still functional. U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,218 to Snyder et al. discloses a scenting device for attachment to an air filter in a heating, ventilating, or air conditioning (HVAC) system. However, Snyder&#39;s device provides gel-containing compartments mounted on a solid surface that is in turn attached to an air filter making changes cumbersome and complicated each time a stronger or new scent is desired. This method also forces the user to endure the latest scent installed until it evaporates completely.  \\n      Recently, there have been patents and developments relate to dispersing scents into the air by the use of ionization. (see WO 00/38512).  \\n      The combination of antimicrobial solutions and scent dispersal has also been previously disclosed as, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,888 to Lupo et al. Also, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,415,675 to Powers et al., is described a fragrant sponge strip which mounts onto an air filter. This fragrant sponge strip has multiple hooks located on the outer edge of the sponge thus requiring the filter to have apertures adapted to receive said hooks. Accordingly, the Powers Sponge Strip is not adapted to be used with all filter systems and could only be effective when there are apertures present for receiving the hooks of the sponge. Again, the user of this method must endure the lifespan of the scent before changing scents unless the entire unit is replaced.  \\n      The term \\u201cair quality\\u201d can be more broadly interpreted as functional, pleasant smelling and safe. \\u201cAir quality\\u201d also relates to simple air scenting for the purpose of pleasure and elimination of bad odors. This has led to many developments relative to this concept, such as those disclosed in the following patents: U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,247 to Rossman et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,859 to Tobin et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,584 to Fritz et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,267,297 B1 to Contadini et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,972 to Muderlak et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,677,441 to Nixon et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,409 to Watkins. U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,327 to Palamand et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,182 to Steiner et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,869 to Stumpf et al.; and finally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,147,582 to Holzner et al.  \\n      Some of these inventions and systems provide a method of scent release by actuation of piezo-electric systems, pressurized aerosols, air flow over scent-containing pieces, or by the evaporation of scented liquids or gels. Recently the detrimental effects on our environment by propellant gases has been discovered and this has prompted many to invent scent dispersal systems that use safe propellants or do not require propellants at all. These harmful propellants are often referred to as \\u201cVolatile Organic Components\\u201d (VOC) or \\u201cchlorofluorocarbons\\u201d (CFC&#39;s), both of which have been used in the past. Devices that avoid the use of propellant gases include U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,474 B1 to Helf et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,117 to Ivri; U.S. Pat. No. 6,196,219 B11 to Hess et al., and more recently EP 01 121 075.4, to Hess et al. and finally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,529,005 to Gueret. These various patents disclose the use of piezo-electric actuation to effectively disperse liquids without propellants. The main problem remaining with most of the devices above, however, is that they are complicated, expensive to produce, difficult to repair and service, and require significant time to refill scents, and change scents and intensities. Another major problem with the aforementioned devices is that they are not portable to be used in other systems of all shapes and sizes and many require electronics, mechanical components, professional installation, professional service, and even air-flow to be effective.  \\n      Consequently, to make piezo-electric systems atomize effectively, at least some solvent is generally required to properly disperse the scents or liquids. Martens et al. states, in document WO 00/47335, that \\u2018the viscosity and surface tension of a liquid to be dispensed can be controlled by adding certain solvents, thereby providing a method of improving the dispensing action of piezo-actuated systems.\\u2019 \\n      Further techniques for ambient air scenting and disinfecting discussed in other submitted patents and documents show the possible use of electronics and circuits to be used in timing, sequencing, and dosing of scent into various living environments, air duct work or conduit. Internationally, there have even been scent sensors used in electronic control circuitry of these scenting devices to control the release of scents and their intensity. Such as: EP 00 118 715.2 (published by the European Patent Office as document EP 1 184 083 A1) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/942,118 are incorporated by reference herein. Also, French document FR 98 04156 to Moy et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,409 to Watkins; European document EP 0 831 384 A1 to Muyarama et al.; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,832,320 and 5,760,873, both to Wittek; and European document EP 00 118 715.2 and corresponding U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/942,118, both to Hess et al. are all examples of this in various forms.  \\n      All prior devices fail to offer enough mounting flexibility and portability to be effective in a wide variety of applications. Another problem with some prior devices and systems is condensation. Some prior devices rely on protruding pieces or processes that must be close to the dispensing unit impeding air flow or causing excess sound from the air turbulence. Another major drawback is the lack of selection of scents that are both available and instantly changeable. All seem to require some programming, refilling, disassembly, filter changes, professional service, electrical disconnection, endurance of last scent installed, evaporation, or complete replacement. Yet another common drawback to the prior devices is that the control functions are not instantly flexible and changeable which leaves the user little or no possibility of quick adjustment to his or her preferences. Another drawback is the intense beginning and subsequent slow weakening of scents. This occurs as the media in which the scent has been installed in slowly evaporates making the scent intensity difficult to monitor. In fact, in U.S. Pat. Publication No.: U.S. 2003/0097936 A1 Maleeny et al. states \\u201cAn expert panel considered the vanilla scent to be strong for the first three days, pleasant for an additional fourteen days and perceptible for remainder of the test period.\\u201d In other words, it starts strong and gradually grows weaker until evaporation is complete. Prior devices contain environmental drawbacks as well. These include: scent removal, solvent additives, and poor storage ability or disposal of unwanted scents as once many of them are opened, smeared on, poured in, electrically discharged, or installed, they are impossible to return to a scent free sealed container to be stored and reused again at the discretion of the operator. This promotes waste and endurance of scent for the period of time the scent is evaporating or dispersing. In other words, the prior devices do not permit immediate selection, dispersal, changeability, or closed storage of scent at the discretion of the operator either.  \\n      Another drawback is that all aforementioned systems have components that can wear out. Comprehensively, major drawbacks of all aforementioned devices include the fact that they are not installable, serviceable, removable, storable, and re-installable by virtually any user.  \\n      Another drawback of all prior devices is the inability of all aforementioned devices and apparatuses to be completely portable to even the outdoors, and to contain multiple, changeable scents that can be changed, dispensed and/or refilled at any time by the operator.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      Consequently, there still exists the need for a method of scenting and refreshing air that improves upon prior devices. It is therefore an objective of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks of these prior devices. It has been found that the improvement of all above stated objects, as well as further improvements over the prior art, may be achieved by using cartridges contained in a base unit that is attachable to a variety of surfaces. Wherein said base unit contains removable, replaceable, seal able, storable, easily serviced cartridges containing atomizable scents. These scents contained in said cartridges can be manually distributed to airflow systems and ambient environment of all types and at the instant discretion of the operator.  \\n      In particular, it is the object of the present invention to provide the immediate change of scent to address personal preferences as well as almost unlimited scent choices with several contained at all times in base unit.  \\n      It is a further object of the present invention to elimination of waste of scent that occurs in the unregulated discharge of many material-absorbed or evaporative scent systems.  \\n      It is a further object of the present invention to provide long-term scent free storage for unwanted cartridges, whether full or partially used, thus eliminating waste and providing a method to re-use said cartridges at any time. This would especially apply to seasonal or specific scents.  \\n      It is a further object of the present invention is to eliminate the technicality of operation and provide non-technical user installation and serviceability at any time in almost any environment.  \\n      Its is a further object of the present invention to reduce the price of purchase for base unit, scent cartridges, and cartridge refills to a price point that is affordable for all.  \\n      It is a further object of the present invention to provide instant removal and complete portability of base unit and cartridges.  \\n      It is a further object of the present invention to eliminate the problem of proper scent intensity by providing contained scent and manual operation.  \\n      It is a further object of the present invention to completely eliminate the usage of potentially harmful solvents, gels, wicks, and waxes.  \\n      It is yet another object of the present invention to eliminate the need for electricity or electronics and mechanical service.  \\n      It is yet another object of the present invention to provide many various mounting configurations providing placement on the exterior of grates, fan guards and vents of all types as well as adhesive and plastic non-conductive prongs for placement in outlets and stand-alone applications of all types.  \\n      In keeping with the principles of the present invention, a unique scenting device is herein disclosed. The scenting device has a base unit with means of attachment to various intake airflow and HVAC grates and vents, as well as to various air outflow grates and fan systems of all types. The base unit can also be \\u201cplugged in\\u201d to electric wall outlets via non-conductive, non-functioning plastic prongs for simple mounting with no electrical function. Aforementioned base unit is also easily removable from all areas and able to be taken portably anywhere to be used in all environments, including the outdoors with potentially hundreds of scent choices. Present invention is proposed as being marketed with the title \\u201cHome Aroma Therapy,\\u201d or \\u201cEasy Fresh,\\u201d or the like.  \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is an enlarged view of the face of the base unit with scent containing cartridges protruding slightly on the top.

Field  \\n      The present invention relates generally to the sale and/or purchase of linear accelerators used in radiation therapy.  \\n      2. Description  \\n      According to conventional radiation treatment, a beam of radiation is directed toward a tumor located within a patient. The radiation beam delivers a predetermined dose of radiation to the tumor according to an established treatment plan. The delivered radiation kills cells of the tumor by causing ionizations within the cells.  \\n      Treatment plans are therefore designed to maximize radiation delivered to a target while minimizing radiation delivered to healthy tissue. In order to achieve these goals, however, a treatment plan must accurately account for the expected characteristics of the specific radiation beam that will be used to deliver the radiation. These characteristics may include values such as intensity, flatness, symmetry and penumbra.  \\n      Commissioning refers to, among other things, a process for determining radiation beam characteristics. Particularly, a device for generating a radiation beam may be commissioned in order to determine characteristics of its particular radiation beam. The characteristics may then be used by a treatment planning system to design treatment plans that will be executed using the particular radiation beam.  \\n      A linear accelerator is one example of a device for generating and directing a radiation beam toward a patient. Conventionally, a buyer purchases a linear accelerator from a manufacturer and the linear accelerator is delivered to the buyer. Employees or contractors of the buyer then proceed to commission the linear accelerator in order to obtain characteristics, or beam data, of a radiation beam generated by the linear accelerator. The data may then be used to create a data book for commissioning a treatment planning system. The commissioning process often requires several weeks of work by one or more radiation oncology physicists. During this time, the linear accelerator cannot be used for treating patients.  \\n      It would therefore be beneficial to provide a system to reduce the loss of time and/or revenue due to commissioning after receipt of a linear accelerator by a buyer.  \\n     SUMMARY  \\n      To address at least the above problems, some embodiments of the present invention provide a system, method, apparatus, and means to sell a linear accelerator to emit treatment radiation to a buyer, commission the linear accelerator, and, after commissioning the linear accelerator, transmit the linear accelerator to the buyer. In some embodiments, commissioning the linear accelerator may include modeling a treatment planning system based on the beam data.  \\n      Some aspects provide buying a linear accelerator to emit treatment radiation and a service to commission the linear accelerator from a seller and receipt of the linear accelerator from the seller after the linear accelerator has been commissioned. In further aspects, a data book or other medium including a modeled data set is received from the seller.  \\n      The claims are not limited to the disclosed embodiments, as those skilled in the art can readily adapt the teachings of the present application to create other embodiments. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is a flow diagram of a process according to some embodiments.  \\n       FIG. 2  is a view of a test cell according to some embodiments.  \\n       FIG. 3  is a flow diagram of a process according to some embodiments.  \\n       FIG. 4  is a flow diagram of a process according to some embodiments.  \\n       FIG. 5  is a view of a linear accelerator in a radiation treatment room according to some embodiments.  \\n       FIG. 6  is a flow diagram of a process according to some embodiments. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION  \\n      The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the embodiments described herein and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those in the art.  \\n       FIG. 1  is a flow diagram of process  100  according to some embodiments. Process  100  may be used to prepare a linear accelerator for use by a buyer. Process  100  may be executed by one or more individuals and/or business entities. In some embodiments, process  100  is executed by employees of a manufacturer of linear accelerators, such as employees of Siemens Corporation\\u00ae. The steps of process  100  may be attributed to the manufacturer in such embodiments.  \\n      Initially, at step S 101 , a linear accelerator to emit treatment radiation is sold to a buyer. Details of a linear accelerator according to some embodiments will be discussed below. Step S 101  may comprise entering into a binding contract to exchange a linear accelerator with a buyer for some manner of compensation. In this regard, the terms \\u201csell\\u201d, \\u201csale\\u201d, and \\u201csold\\u201d are not necessarily used herein according to their common meaning of a full transfer of ownership. The linear accelerator may be \\u201csold\\u201d to the buyer in step S 101  under terms of a lease or any other type of contract in which possession of a good is transferred in exchange for some compensation.  \\n      The buyer may be any individual and/or entity. Non-exhaustive examples include hospitals, universities, dedicated research facilities, and private physicians groups. According to some embodiments of step S 101 , the buyer contacts the seller regarding an interest in a linear accelerator offered for sale by the seller. The sale may occur after several exchanges of technical information, negotiating positions, and business information. Other scenarios may precede the sale of step S 101 , including those in which communication between the buyer and seller is initiated by the seller.  \\n      The seller commissions the linear accelerator in step S 102 . The commissioning may comprise at least the determination of beam data associated with the linear accelerator. Step S 102  may be performed by employees, contractors or other persons hired by the seller for this purpose. In some examples, the seller enters into a contract with a separate business entity to provide commissioning services to the seller. The commissioning may occur on premises of the seller and/or at one or more other locations.  \\n      Any currently- or hereafter-known system for commissioning a linear accelerator may be employed in step S 102 . Some details of a commissioning process according to some embodiments will be provided below.  \\n      Next, in step S 103 , the seller transmits the linear accelerator to the buyer. Any suitable currently- or hereafter-known system to transmit goods may be used in step S 103 . In one example, the seller contracts with a freight service to pick up the linear accelerator at its location after step S 102  and to deliver it (e.g., by truck, rail and/or ship) to the buyer. The seller may alternatively arrange for shipment to a shipping point (e.g., a port) from where the buyer will pick up the linear accelerator according to known procedures. The seller may transmit different parts of the linear accelerator at different times according to some embodiments of step S 103 .  \\n      Some embodiments of process  100  reduce a delay between the sale of a linear accelerator and the use of the linear accelerator for radiation treatment.  \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates test cell  100  pursuant to some embodiments. As shown, test cell  100  includes linear accelerator (linac)  110 , imaging system  120 , and operator station  130 . Test cell  100  may comprise a location in which a recently-manufactured linear accelerator undergoes post-manufacturing testing. Linac  110  may comprise any linear accelerator configured to emit radiation. Examples of linac  110  according to some embodiments include the PRIMUS\\u00ae and ONCOR\\u00ae linear accelerators produced by Siemens Corporation\\u00ae. Linac  110  includes a linear accelerator waveguide (not shown) used to produce a beam of electrons. The electrons may be directed to a target, thereby causing the emission of an X-ray radiation beam.  \\n      Treatment head  112  of linac  110  may include a beam-emitting device (not shown) for emitting the radiation beam during commissioning, testing, calibration, verification, and/or treatment. Although X-ray radiation is mentioned above, the radiation beam may comprise electron, photon or any other type of radiation. According to some embodiments, the treatment radiation comprises megavoltage radiation. Also included within treatment head  112  may be a beam-shielding device (not shown) for shaping the beam and for shielding sensitive surfaces from the beam.  \\n      Treatment head  112  is fastened to a projection of gantry  114 . Gantry  114  is rotatable around gantry axis  116  in order to rotate treatment head  112  around axis  116 .  \\n      In operation, treatment radiation is delivered from linac  110  treatment head  112  and is emitted therefrom as a divergent beam. The beam is emitted towards a point, known as the isocenter, which may be located at the intersection of an axis of the beam and gantry axis  116 . Due to divergence of the radiation beam and the shaping of the beam by the aforementioned beam-shaping devices, the beam may deliver radiation to a multi-dimensional radiation field rather than only to the isocenter.  \\n      Imaging system  120  may be used to acquire images that may be used for commissioning, testing, calibration, verification, and/or treatment. For example, imaging system  120  may be used to acquire images of the aforementioned multi-dimensional radiation field. Such images may be used to acquire and/or confirm beam characteristics during the commissioning process. According to some embodiments, test cell  100  does not include imaging system  120 .  \\n      Imaging system  120  may comprise any suitable type of imaging system. Imaging system  120  may comprise a flat-panel imaging device using a scintillator layer and solid-state amorphous silicon photodiodes deployed in a two-dimensional array. In some examples, imaging system  120  converts X-ray radiation to and stores X-ray radiation as electrical charge without use of a scintillator layer. In such imaging systems, X-rays are absorbed directly by an array of amorphous selenium photoconductors. The photoconductors convert the X-rays directly to stored electrical charge that comprises an acquired image of a radiation field. Imaging system  120  may also comprise a CCD or tube-based camera. Such an imaging device may include a light-proof housing within which are disposed a scintillator, a mirror, and a camera.  \\n      In some embodiments, test cell  100  includes a table for supporting phantoms, scanning systems with or without ion chambers, or other devices that may be used during testing and/or commissioning of linac  110 . Such a table may be adjustable to assist in positioning devices such as the foregoing at the isocenter of linac  110 .  \\n      A radiation oncology physicist may operate operator station  140  to commission linac  110  according to some embodiments. Operator station  140  may be located apart from linac  110 , such as in a different room, in order to protect an operator from radiation emitted thereby. For example, linac  110  may be located in a heavily shielded room, such as a concrete vault, which shields an operator from the radiation emitted by linac  110 .  \\n      Using operator station  130 , the radiation oncology physicist may control linac  110  to emit a radiation beam according to desired parameters. Devices such as imaging system  120 , phantoms, scanning systems with or without ion chambers, and other devices may then be used to acquire beam data associated with the radiation beam. The beam data may be stored in a storage medium of processor  132 . Operator station  130  may be operated in test cell  100  to perform tasks other than commissioning, such as testing, calibration, and other tasks.  \\n      Although a single processor  132  is depicted in  FIG. 2 , those in the art will appreciate that the functions described herein may be accomplished using one or more computing devices operating together or independently. Any suitable general-purpose or specially-programmed computer may be used to achieve the functionality described herein.  \\n       FIG. 3  is a diagram of process  300 , which provides additional detail to some embodiments of process  100 . Process  300  may be performed by any entity or entities described above with respect to process  100 .  \\n      A linear accelerator to emit treatment radiation may be sold to a buyer in step S 301  as described with respect to step S 101 . For purposes of the present example, it will be assumed that linac  110  of  FIG. 2  is sold to the buyer in step S 301 . Moreover, it will be assumed that the seller is the manufacturer of linac  110 . In some embodiments, the seller may be a reseller, a retailer, and/or a distributor of linac  110 .  \\n      Next, in step S 302 , the seller acquires beam data associated with linac  110 . The beam data may be acquired according to any currently- or hereafter-known systems for commissioning a linear accelerator. As known, beam data may include central axis dosage, scattered radiation values, wedge attenuation information, etc.  \\n      Some embodiments of step S 302  comprise manual or automated operation of operator station  130  according to software executed by processor  132  to control linac  110  to emit various radiation beams. Devices such as those described above may then be operated to acquire beam data based on the emitted beams. In some embodiments, the devices, which may or may not include imaging system  120 , are in communication with processor  132  and may be controlled thereby to acquire the beam data. According to such embodiments, the acquired beam data may then be stored within a storage medium of processor  132 .  \\n      In some embodiments, the commissioning of process  300  is based on a treatment planning system associated with the buyer. Accordingly, the beam data may be generated based on the treatment planning system. For example, the buyer may identify a treatment planning system to the seller prior to step S 302 . A treatment planning system may be used to define and simulate a beam shape that is required to deliver an appropriate dose of radiation to a treatment area within a patient. A treatment planning system therefore requires information regarding a beam produced by a linear accelerator in order to accurately simulate a to-be-delivered radiation beam. Such information is known as the beam data associated with the linear accelerator.  \\n      As is known in the art, different treatment planning systems may require different beam data to simulate a radiation beam. For example, a treatment planning system may require data indicating a dose distribution within a first field size for specified energies at a first distance, while a second treatment planning system may require data indicating a dose distribution within a second field size for second specified energies at a second distance.  \\n      A data book including the beam data is generated in step S 303 . As is also known in the art, the data book may be provided in tabular and/or graphical form to comply with certain requirements and/or regulations governing the commissioning of a linear accelerator. The data book may be generated using known automated computer routines.  \\n      In step S 304 , a treatment planning system is modeled based on the beam data. Again, it is known in the art to model a treatment planning system based on beam data that is associated with a linear accelerator. Roughly, a modeled treatment planning system allows simulation of a radiation beam for which the treatment planning system does not have specific beam data.  \\n      In other words, the acquired beam data describes a small percentage of the possible treatment scenarios. A treatment planning system therefore uses algorithms to simulate a radiation beam that does not fit exactly within one of the scenarios described by the beam data. Modeling the treatment system comprises fine-tuning these algorithms to result in a match between simulated beam data and measured data in all treatment scenarios including those scenarios described by the beam data. Modeling the treatment planning system in step S 304  may produce a data set that has been modeled for the treatment planning system.  \\n      The linear accelerator, the data book, and a modeled data set for the treatment planning system are transmitted to the buyer in step S 305 . Any suitable currently- or hereafter-known transmission system or systems may be used in step S 305 . One or more of the linear accelerator, the data book, and the modeled treatment planning system data may be transmitted to the buyer by different methods.  \\n      According to some embodiments, a modeled treatment planning system is generated in step S 304 . Therefore, the modeled treatment planning system may also or alternatively be transmitted to the buyer in step S 305 .  \\n      In some embodiments of process  300 , other quality assurance steps are performed prior to step S 305 . These steps may include one or more of: completing a checklist for each step of the measurement and analysis process, comparing the generated beam data with beam data associated with other linear accelerators; double checking each measurement by a minimum of two qualified persons; graphically analyzing all measured data to assure accuracy of the data and to identify possible outlier data points; and final reviewing of the data book and the commissioning process by a senior medical physicist.  \\n      Flow proceeds directly from step S 303  to step S 305  according to some embodiments of process  300 . Specifically, such embodiments do not comprise modeling of a treatment planning system by the seller. Such embodiments provide a buyer with an option to model the treatment planning system at its own facilities using a contractor and/or an employee of their choice. Accordingly, neither a modeled data set for a treatment planning system nor a modeled treatment planning system is transmitted to the buyer in step S 305  of such embodiments. Rather, beam data formatted for a specified treatment planning system is transmitted to the buyer for use in modeling.  \\n       FIG. 4  is a flow diagram of process steps  400  performed by a buyer according to some embodiments. As mentioned above, a buyer may include a hospital, a university, a dedicated research facility, an individual, a private physicians group, and any other entity desiring a linear accelerator. Process  400  may, in some embodiments, decrease the time required between receipt of a linear accelerator and use of the linear accelerator to provide radiation treatment.  \\n      Initially, in step S 401 , the buyer buys a linear accelerator to emit treatment radiation and a service to commission the linear accelerator from a seller. \\u201cBuying\\u201d the linear accelerator as referred to herein may comprise entering into a lease or any other type of contract in which possession of the linear accelerator will be transferred to the buyer in exchange for some compensation. In some embodiments, the buyer&#39;s right to possess and/or use the linear accelerator may be subject to additional compensation and/or may expire over time.  \\n      According to some embodiments, the linear accelerator and the service may or may not be bought simultaneously. Either may be bought before the other, with any amount of time passing between the buying of the linear accelerator and the buying of the service. In one example, the buyer buys the linear accelerator, the linear accelerator is manufactured, and the buyer buys the service when the linear accelerator is in a test cell undergoing post-manufacturing testing.  \\n      The linear accelerator is received from the seller in step S 402  after the linear accelerator has been commissioned. The linear accelerator may be received in any currently- or hereafter-known manner for receiving goods. The buyer may receive different parts of the linear accelerator at different times according to some embodiments of step S 402 .  \\n       FIG. 5  is a view of radiation treatment room  500  of a buyer according to some embodiments. Room  500  may be located remotely from test cell  100 . Room  500  includes linac  110  and imaging system  120 , as it will be assumed that the buyer received linac  110  and imaging system  120  in step S 402 . Room  500  also includes table  530  and operator station  540 . Radiation treatment room  500  may be used to provide radiation treatment to a patient according to some embodiments.  \\n      Table  530  may support devices such as phantoms, scanning systems with or without scanning ion chambers, positioning wedges or the like that may be used during commissioning verification, quality assurance, calibration, and/or radiation treatment. Table  530  may be adjustable to assist in positioning devices and/or a treatment area of a patient at the isocenter of linac  110 .  \\n      An operator may operate operator station  540  to verify beam data of linac  110  according to some embodiments. Operator station  540  may also be used to deliver radiation according to a treatment plan. As such, operator station  540  may be located apart from linac  110  in order to shield an operator from radiation emitted thereby.  \\n       FIG. 6  is a flow diagram of process  600  to be executed by a buyer according to some embodiments. In this regard, the buyer buys a linear accelerator to emit treatment radiation and a service to commission the linear accelerator from a seller in step S 601 . Next, the linear accelerator is received from the seller in step S 602  after the linear accelerator has been commissioned. Steps S 601  and S 602  may proceed as described above with respect to steps S 401  and S 402 .  \\n      In step S 603 , the buyer receives beam data that was generated during the commissioning of the linear accelerator. The beam data may be received in electronic and/or hardcopy format (e.g., a data book) from the seller or from another party. Operation of the linear accelerator is then verified in step S 604  based on the received beam data, which may include a specific set of data measured specifically for verifying linac performance. In some embodiments of step S 604 , operation is verified by recreating in treatment room  500  some or all of the linac configurations used to acquire the beam data in test cell  100  and comparing the resulting data with the received beam data.  \\n      Next, in step S 605 , a treatment planning system is modeled based on the received beam data as described with respect to step S 304 . Process  600  therefore reflects some embodiments in which the seller does not model the treatment planning system prior to transmitting the linear accelerator to the buyer. The modeling may be verified after step S 605 .  \\n      In a case that the seller modeled the treatment planning system as in process  300 , step S 605  may be substituted with a step in which the modeling is verified. The modeling may be verified using known techniques. These techniques may include determining expected beam characteristics in a particular treatment scenario using the treatment planning system, and then comparing the expected beam characteristics against actual beam characteristics acquired in treatment room  500  under the scenario.  \\n      Those in the art will appreciate that various adaptations and modifications of the above-described embodiments can be configured without departing from the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. Also, embodiments of the claimed invention may differ from the descriptions above.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005191455-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A modified notepaper is provided, including a paper, an adhesive area coated with a special glue, and at least a folding line cutting across the paper and bordering on the edge of the adhesive area.

Field of the Invention  \\n      The present invention relates to a modified self-adhesive notepaper, and in particular to a self-adhesive notepaper with at least a folding line so that the notepaper can be folded and posted on both sides.  \\n      2. The Related Art  \\n      Self-adhesive notepapers come handy when one person tries to leave a note for another person, or uses it as a personal reminder. The self-adhesive notepaper is a small-sized paper with a special adhesive material coated on a small area of its back, usually in a shape of a stripe. The special adhesive material allows the notepaper to be easily removed without leaving any trace on the surface the note originally adhered to.  \\n      However, the observation shows that most people only use one side of the notepapers even though that both sides of the note have space to write message on. This is because that the bask side of the notepaper with the small area coated with adhesive material is usually facing away from the view when the note is posted. As a notepaper usually costs more than a regular paper without the self-adhesion, it is worth the effort to have the notepaper redesigned, so that a user can fully utilized the spaces available on both sides of the note.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a self-adhesive notepaper that the space available on both sides of the note can be fully utilized. The present invention includes a folding line along the adhesive area, usually forming a narrow band. When the notepaper is used for the first time, the message can be written on the front side, and the note can be post as the regular notepaper. In addition, the notepaper can be folded along the folding line so that the rest of the area on the back side can face the viewer, while the adhesive area on the back adheres to a flat surface. In this way, both sides of the modified notepaper of the present invention can be fully utilized.  \\n      The advantages of the modified notepapers over the regular notepapers include: \\n          1. Cost reduction: both sides of the modified notepaper can be utilized for the cost of one regular notepaper;     2. Environmental friendliness: the amount of paper waste can be reduced as more messages can be written on a modified notepaper; and     3. Easy production: the manufacturing process can be easily carried out with value-added feature of the modified notepaper.        \\n\\n      The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, which show, for purposes of illustration only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is a front view of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 2  is a back view of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 3  is a sectional diagram of the structure of the notepaper in accordance with the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4  is a notepaper that is bent along the folding line;  \\n       FIG. 5  is a sectional diagram of a folded notepaper with its back side facing the viewer in accordance with the invention.  \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  \\n       FIG. 1  and  FIG. 2  show the front view and the back view of a modified notepaper of the present invention, respectively. As shown in  FIG. 1  and  FIG. 2 , a modified notepaper comprises a paper  1 , an adhesive area  2  coated with a special glue, and at least a folding line  3  cutting across paper  1  and bordering on the edge of adhesive area  2 . Paper  1  is usually small in size, although large-sized notepapers can also be manufactured. In addition, paper  1  can be of any shape, although a rectangular shape is shown in the embodiment. Adhesive area  2  is usually on the back side of paper  1 , and forms a shape of stripe closer to an edge of paper  1 , as shown in the embodiment. However, the adhesive area can be of any shape. Folding line  3  is placed between adhesive area  2  and the rest of the available writing space of the back side. Folding line  3  is bordering on the edge of adhesive area so that the maximum area is available when the notepaper is folded along folding line  3 . Folding line  3  can be a continuous dent trench formed by a press machine, a dash dent trench formed by a press machine, or a series of tooth holes, or perforation line, formed by a punch machine. A plurality of folding lines  3  can also be implemented.  \\n       FIG. 3 ,  FIG. 4  and  FIG. 5  show how an embodiment of the notepaper of the present invention is in use. In  FIG. 3 , the notepaper of the present invention adheres, with adhesive area  2 , to a surface of an object  4 . As shown in  FIG. 3 , the front side A is facing the viewer, and the back side B is facing the away from the viewer and towards object  4 . Front side A is used for message writing, as a conventional regular notepaper. When the user uses the notepaper for a second message or in reply to the first message, the user folds along folding line  3  and bends paper  1  towards the direction of front side A, as indicated in  FIG. 4 , so that adhesive area is still exposed. In  FIG. 5 , adhesive area  2  of the notepaper adheres to object  4 , and back side B of paper  1  is now facing the viewer and available for message writing.  \\n      It is worth noticing that the folding of the notepaper does not impair the adhesiveness of adhesive area  2 , as paper  1  is bended in the direction so that adhesive area  2  can still be used to adhere to a surface of any object.  \\n      With the notepaper of the present invention, both sides of the note can be used for message exchange. It does not only reduce the expense on post-it paper, but also reduce the paper waste imposed on the environment. In addition, the manufacture process of this value-added feature can be easily carried out.  \\n      Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that a variety of modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention which is intended to be defined by the appended claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005203719-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"In calculating a substrate current Isub using a substrate current model equation expressed as Isub=(Ai/Bi)\\u00b7(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)\\u00b7Id\\u00b7exp (\\u2212Bi\\u00b7lc/(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)) (where Id, Vds and Vdsat are drain current, a drain voltage and a saturation drain voltage, respectively, of a MOS transistor, lc is a characteristic length, Ai is a model parameter and Bi is a given constant), the characteristic length lc is a function lc=lc[lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd] (where lc 0  and lc 1  are model parameters) of a primary expression (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) regarding a gate-drain voltage Vgd (=Vgs\\u2212Vds: Vgs is a gate voltage of the MOS transistor) of the MOS transistor.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"1 .

The present invention particularly relates to enhancement of accuracy in the simulation.  \\n      As the density and integration level of semiconductor integrated circuit devices have increased and the devices have been miniaturized, the sizes of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistors constituting the devices have been greatly reduced. With this reduction in the sizes of the MOS transistors, especially reduction in the channel length, hot-carrier degradation, which is a large issue in the reliability of the MOS transistors, has become more serious.  \\n      This hot-carrier degradation occurs when electrons and holes (which will be correctively referred to as \\u201chot carriers\\u201d) with high energy are generated by a high electric field in a drain end of a MOS transistor and these hot carriers causes degradation of properties of a gate oxide film. This hot-carrier degradation has a plurality of degradation modes. Out of these degradation modes, in a degradation mode in which substrate current is at the maximum, drain current decreases with time in both an n-MOS transistor and a p-MOS transistor. This results in an occurrence of degradation, i.e., the delay time of a circuit increases with time. When the increase of the delay time exceeds a certain amount, a timing error occurs during signal input/output operation within a semiconductor integrated circuit or between the circuit and the outside. This causes a malfunction of a whole system in which the semiconductor integrated circuit is incorporated.  \\n      On this hot-carrier degradation, a conventional hot-carrier reliability evaluation using an accelerated stress test under a DC condition of a MOS transistor has been performed. In this conventional evaluation, the fabrication process is optimized to meet requirements of the hot-carrier evaluation so that the reliability of products is enhanced.  \\n      In recent years, however, the conventional hot-carrier reliability evaluation performed under a DC condition has a difficulty in satisfying the requirements of the evaluation. In view of this, new techniques with which a simulation of hot-carrier degradation in a semiconductor integrated device (hereinafter, referred to as a \\u201ccircuit reliability simulation\\u201d) is performed so as to enhance the reliability of products have been devised. In a circuit reliability simulation, circuit operation after hot-carrier degradation is simulated using a hot-carrier lifetime model and parameters of a circuit simulator SPICE after the degradation based on voltages at terminals and current values in a transistor calculated by the SPICE.  \\n      Typical circuit reliability simulators are a BERT (see reference 1, R. H. Tu et al., Berkeley reliability tools\\u2014BERT, IEEE Trans. Compt.\\u2014Aided Des. Integrated Circuits &amp; Syst., the United States, October 1993, Vol. 12, No. 10, pp. 1524-1534) developed by the University of California at Berkeley or its commercially-available counterpart, BTABERT. These circuit reliability simulation techniques are used to predict a degradation/failure part of a semiconductor integrated circuit so that measures are taken for this predicted part during the design of the circuit. This enables establishment or design of the reliability.  \\n      Examples of the method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a MOS transistor include a method described in reference 2 (Kuo et al., IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, the United States, July 1988, Vol. 35, pp. 1004-1011). A hot-carrier lifetime model used by a circuit reliability simulator for implementing this method has the following features:  \\n      Hot-carrier degradation in a MOS transistor is evaluated by using the ratio \\u0394Id/Id of the amount \\u0394Id of a change in drain current to initial drain current Id and other values. Under static hot-carrier stress conditions using direct current (DC), the hot-carrier degradation rate \\u0394Id/Id is expressed by the following equation (1): \\n \\n\\u0394 Id/Id=A\\u00b7t   n \\u2003\\u2003(1) \\n          where t is the hot-carrier stressing time, A and n are assumed to be coefficients depending on a fabrication process of a transistor and stress conditions.        \\n\\n      Suppose the stressing time until the rate of the change in drain current (i.e., hot-carrier degradation rate) reaches a given value (\\u0394Id/Id) f  is transistor lifetime \\u03c4, the following equation (2) is derived from equation (1) \\n \\n(\\u0394 Id/Id ) f   =A\\u00b7\\u03c4   n \\u2003\\u2003(2) \\n \\n      Time t until (\\u0394Id/Id) f =10%, for example, is defined as lifetime \\u03c4 by using equation (2).  \\n      According to reference 2, lifetime \\u03c4 of a MOS transistor is given by the following Equation (3) regarding an experiment using a hot-carrier lifetime model \\n \\n\\u03c4=((\\u0394 Id/Id ) f ) l/n   \\u00b7H\\u00b7W\\u00b7Isub   \\u2212m   \\u00b7Id   m\\u22121 \\u2003\\u2003(3) \\n          where W is the gate width, H is a coefficient depending on conditions for fabricating a transistor, Isub is substrate current and m can be interpreted as an index related to impact ionization and formation of an interface state.        \\n\\n      I-V characteristics of a MOS transistor after degradation can be simulated using a \\u0394Id model. Examples of a simulation method using the \\u0394Id model include a method disclosed in reference 3 (Quader et al., IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, the United States, December 1993, Vol. 40, pp. 2245-2254.)  \\n      In a \\u0394Id model, degradation amount \\u0394Id of drain current is added to fresh drain current (i.e., initial drain current) before stressing, thereby simulating drain current Id\\u2032 after degradation, as expressed by the following equation (4): \\n \\n Id\\u2032=Id ( Vds, Vgs )+\\u0394 Id ( Age, Vds, Vgs )\\u2003\\u2003(4) \\n          where Id is a function of drain voltage Vds and gate voltage Vgs, and \\u0394Id is a function of drain voltage Vds and gate voltage Vgs and is also a function of Age. The term Age indicates the amount of stress until time t (hot-carrier stressing time) after the beginning of hot-carrier stressing in a hot-carrier lifetime model. In a physical aspect, Age indicates the total amount of hot carriers with energy which exceeds a critical energy necessary to cause damage on a MOS transistor out of the hot carriers generated until time t.        \\n\\n      To calculate Age in a circuit under dynamic stress conditions with alternating current (AC), the following Equation (5), which is an integration regarding time, is used. \\n \\nAge=\\u222b[( W\\u00b7H ) \\u22121   \\u00b7Isub   m   \\u00b7Id   l\\u2212m   ]dt \\u2003\\u2003(5) \\n          where the integrand in Equation (5) is the reciprocal of a standardized lifetime given by Equation (3).        \\n\\n      During the simulation, a SPICE model is used to calculate drain current Id in Equation (3) or (5). As an example of this SPICE model, a Berkeley Short-Channel IGFET Model (BSIM) technique described in, for example, reference 4 (Sheu et al. IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, the United States, August 1987, Vol. SC-22, pp. 558-566) is used.  \\n      During the simulation, a substrate current model is used to determine substrate current Isub in Equation (3) or (5). As an example of the method for calculating substrate current Isub, a method disclosed in, for example, reference 5 (Chan et al. IEEE Electron Device Lett., the United States, December 1984, Vol. EDL-5, pp. 505-507) is used.  \\n      This substrate current model is expressed by the following equation (6): \\n \\n Isub =( Ai/Bi )\\u00b7( Vds\\u2212Vdsat )\\u00b7 Id \\u00b7exp(\\u2212 Bi\\u00b7lc /( Vds\\u2212Vdsat ))\\u2003\\u2003(6) \\n          where Vds is a drain voltage, Vdsat is a saturation drain voltage, Ai and Bi are constants and lc is the characteristic length. Characteristic length lc is an amount indicating the length of exponential decay of the electric field intensity peak in the drain end and is assumed to be approximately a constant. Specifically, characteristic length lc is approximately expressed by the following equation (7) using gate oxide film thickness Tox and drain junction depth Xj \\n \\n Ic =(\\u03b5 Si   \\u00b7Tox\\u00b7Xj/\\u03b5   ox ) 1/2 \\u2003\\u2003(7) \\n    where \\u03b5 Si  is the dielectric constant of silicon and \\u03b5 ox  is the dielectric constant of a silicon oxide film.        \\n\\n      The condition necessary for drain junction depth Xj to appear in Equation (7) is that the vertical electric field in the drain end can be disregarded at drain junction depth Xj. An example of a method for deriving Equation (7) is disclosed in reference 6 (Y. Taur et al., Fundamentals of Modern VLSI Devices, the United States, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 154-158.) Characteristic length lc given by Equation (7) is not dependent on the voltages at respective terminals of a MOS transistor. However, in practice, lc is dependent on the voltages at terminals. Therefore, in the circuit reliability simulator BTABERT described above, a model equation for lc having dependence on drain voltage Vds is used as expressed by the following equation (8): \\n \\n lc =( lc   0 + lc   1 \\u00b7 Vds )\\u00b7( Tox ) 1/2 \\u2003\\u2003(8) \\n          where lc 0  and lc 1  are parameters indicating the dependence of lc on Vds. An example of a substrate current model using Equation (8) is described in reference 7 (BTA Technology, Inc., BTABERT User&#39;s Manual Version 2.31, the United States, BTA Technology, Inc., Sep. 12, 1996, pp. 2-1 to 2-3.)        \\n\\n      Hereinafter, a method for extracting parameters lc 0  and lc 1  and constant Ai mentioned above from experimental data will be described specifically.  \\n       FIG. 7  is a graph for explaining a method for extracting parameters of a conventional substrate current model from experimental data. Specifically,  FIG. 7  is a plot for determining parameters lc 0  and lc 1  and constant Ai included in Equations (6) and (8) of a conventional substrate current model. In  FIG. 7 , the ordinate indicates Isub/(Id\\u00b7(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)) obtained by dividing ratio Isub/Id, i.e., the ratio of substrate current Isub to drain current Id, by difference Vds\\u2212Vdsat between drain voltage Vds and saturation drain voltage Vdsat using a log scale whereas the abscissa indicates the reciprocal 1/(Vds\\u2212Vdsat) of difference Vds\\u2212Vdsat between drain voltage Vds and saturation drain voltage Vdsat. Reference numeral  21  denotes data regarding measurement points based on Isub measurement and Id measurement at drain voltages Vds of a MOS transistor. Reference numeral  22  denotes lines fitted to the data regarding the measurement points at drain voltages Vds. Drain current Id and substrate current Isub of a MOS transistor are measured by varying gate voltage Vgs under four drain voltages Vds (=2.3V, 2.7V, 3.1V and 3.5V). In this case, substrate voltage vbs is 0V. From the measurement results on drain current Id and substrate current Isub, saturation drain voltage Vdsat is obtained as a function of gate voltage Vgs. An example of a method for determining saturation drain voltage Vdsat is described in reference 5. Then, Isub/(Id\\u00b7(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)) and 1/(Vds\\u2212Vdsat) are obtained for each of the measurement points using saturation drain voltage Vdsat. The results are plotted in the manner that the ordinate indicates Isub/(Id\\u00b7(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)) based on a log scale and the abscissa indicates 1/(Vds\\u2212Vdsat).  \\n      When the coordinate axes are set in the manner described above, according to Equation (6), the intercepts (y-axis intercepts) of the lines fitted to the data regarding the measurement points are In (Ai/Bi) (where ln is a natural logarithm) and the slopes of the respective lines are \\u2212Bi\\u00b7lc as long as lc and Ai are constant. Accordingly, lc and Ai are obtained from values of ln (Ai/Bi) and \\u2212Bi\\u00b7lc. For data regarding measurement points at drain voltages Vds, parameters lc 0  and lc 1  and constant Ai in equations (6) and (8) are determined with a method of least squares. Reference numeral  22  in  FIG. 7  denotes lines determined by calculation using the parameters thus obtained at drain voltages Vds based on Equations (6) and (8).  \\n       FIGS. 8A and 8B  are graphs each showing the degree of agreement between the calculated values of substrate current Isub and actually-measured values of substrate current Isub using these parameters. Specifically,  FIGS. 8A and 8B  show comparison between calculated values of substrate current Isub and actually-measured values of substrate current Isub with Equations (6) and (8) of the conventional substrate current model using drain voltage Vds as a parameter. In  FIG. 8A , the ordinate indicates substrate current Isub using a log scale and the abscissa indicates gate voltage Vgs. Reference numeral  23  denotes actually-measured values of substrate current Isub and reference numeral  24  denotes calculated values of substrate current Isub using the parameters determined from the graph shown in  FIG. 7  and Equations (6) and (8). In the same way, in  FIG. 8B , the ordinate indicates substrate current Isub and the abscissa indicates gate voltage Vgs. Reference numeral  25  denotes actually-measured values of substrate current Isub and reference numeral  26  denotes calculated values of substrate current Isub using the parameters determined from the graph shown in  FIG. 7  and Equations (6) and (8).  \\n       FIG. 9  is a flowchart showing a procedure of a method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a circuit using a substrate current model with a conventional technique. The method shown in  FIG. 9  includes steps S 1  through S 4  for making a reliability simulator simulate hot-carrier degradation in a transistor according to Equations (4) through (6) and (8).  \\n      First, at step S 1 , fresh drain current is simulated using transistor parameters before stressing which have been extracted beforehand.  \\n      Next, at step S 2 , substrate current Isub is simulated based on Equations (6) and (8) of the substrate current model, parameters lc 0  and lc 1  determined by the method described with reference to  FIG. 7 , and constant Ai.  \\n      Then, at step S 3 , Age, which indicates degradation of a transistor based on Equation (5), is calculated by performing time integration on a function of drain current Id and substrate current Isub in a circuit. In this calculation, drain current Id simulated at step S 1  and substrate current Isub simulated at step S 2  are used.  \\n      Thereafter, at step S 4 , hot-carrier degradation (specifically drain current Id\\u2032 after degradation) in a transistor is simulated using Equation (4) based on Age calculated at step S 3 .  \\n      However, with the conventional method for simulating hot-carrier degradation, the calculation results on substrate current Isub obtained using the conventional substrate current model deviate from the actually-measured values, as shown in  FIGS. 8A and 8B . This deviation is large especially when drain voltage Vds is low. Specifically, an accurate simulation of hot-carrier degradation is needed when drain voltage Vds is lower than the voltage during stressing, i.e., is at about a level in actual use. On the other hand, in the conventional substrate current model, deviation is large when drain voltage Vds is low. Consequently, there arises the problem of an error in calculating Age is large at step S 3  in the method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a MOS transistor shown in the flowchart of  FIG. 9  and thereby deviation in simulating hot-carrier degradation in the transistor at step S 4  is large. This problem causes another problem that application of a technique for simulating hot-carrier degradation is limited.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      It is therefore an object of the present invention to implement a highly-accurate simulation of hot-carrier degradation widely applicable by creating and using a new high-precision substrate current model.  \\n      In order to achieve this object, the present inventor conducted a study to find causes of the lack of precision of a conventional substrate current model, and finally obtained the following findings:  \\n      (A) Equation (8) showing dependence of characteristic length lc on a terminal voltage in Equation (6) of a substrate current model used in a conventional method for simulating hot-carrier degradation is merely an approximation of a primary expression regarding only drain voltage Vds and therefore lacks a physical basis.  \\n      (B) The assumption that Ai is a constant in Equation (6) has no physical basis.  \\n      In view of the findings, the present inventor devised and applied a new substrate current model having a physical basis, to solve the problem of the lack of accuracy in simulating hot-carrier degradation.  \\n      Specifically, a method for simulating the reliability of a semiconductor device according to the present invention is a method used to simulate the reliability of a semiconductor device based on a predicted value of a substrate current Isub of a MOS transistor constituting the semiconductor device, wherein in calculating the substrate current Isub using a substrate current model equation expressed as \\n \\n Isub =( Ai/Bi )\\u00b7( Vds\\u2212Vdsat )\\u00b7 Id \\u00b7exp(\\u2212 Bi\\u00b7lc /( Vds\\u2212Vdsat )) \\n          (where Id, Vds and Vdsat are drain current, a drain voltage and a saturation drain voltage, respectively, of the MOS transistor, lc is a characteristic length, Ai is a model parameter and Bi is a given constant),     the characteristic length lc is a function lc=lc[lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd] (where lc 0  and lc 1  are model parameters) of a primary expression (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) regarding a gate-drain voltage Vgd (=Vgs\\u2212Vds: Vgs is a gate voltage of the MOS transistor) of the MOS transistor.        \\n\\n      In the method of the present invention, the function lc [lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd] is preferably proportional to (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) 1/4 .  \\n      In the method of the present invention, the model parameter Ai is preferably a function Ai=Ai [lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd] of the primary expression (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) regarding the gate-drain voltage Vgd. In this case, the function Ai [lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd] is preferably proportional to (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) Ai1  (where Ai 1  is a model parameter).  \\n      According to the present invention, model equations showing dependence on terminal voltages with physical bases are used for lc and Ai in Equation (6) of the substrate current model, so that calculation results on the substrate current less deviate from the actually-measured values. Consequently, hot-carrier degradation in a MOS transistor is simulated with high accuracy. In addition, this simulation of hot-carrier degradation is applicable in a wide range.  \\n      As described above, the method for simulating the reliability of a semiconductor device according to the present invention is useful because errors in a hot-carrier simulation for a MOS transistor are reduced when the inventive method is applied to, for example, a method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a semiconductor integrated circuit. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is an illustration for explaining a physical basis of a substrate current model according to the present invention.  \\n       FIG. 2  is an illustration for explaining a physical basis of the substrate current model of the present invention.  \\n       FIG. 3  is a graph for explaining a method for extracting, from experimental data, parameters of a substrate current model in a method for simulating the reliability of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  \\n       FIG. 4A  is a graph for explaining a method for determining parameters lc 0  and lc 1  in the method for simulating the reliability of the semiconductor device of the embodiment of the present invention.

Specifically,  FIG. 1  shows a distribution of carriers in a drain end of an n-MOS transistor operating in a saturation region. The carriers are electrons in the case of the n-MOS transistor but are holes in the case of a p-MOS transistor. That is, the following description is also applicable to a p-MOS transistor if the type and polarity of carriers, for example, are switched.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 1 , a gate electrode  2  is formed over a silicon substrate  1  with a gate oxide film  3  interposed therebetween. A drain region  4  is defined in part of the silicon substrate  1  to a side of the gate electrode  2 . Gate voltage Vgs is applied to the gate electrode  2 . Drain voltage Vds (&gt;saturation drain voltage Vdsat) is applied to the drain region  4 .  \\n      Carriers in a channel  5  of the MOS transistor operating in the saturation region are predominantly affected by a longitudinal (vertical) electric field until the carriers reach a point  6  where the velocity of the carriers is saturated. On the other hand, the intensity of a lateral (horizontal) electric field in the channel  5  is low, carriers in the channel  5  flow in the surface of the silicon substrate  1 , affected by the longitudinal electric field in the gate oxide film  3 . However, as the carriers approach the drain region  4 , the lateral electric field intensity increases so that the mobility velocity is saturated. In a velocity saturation region extending from the point  6  at which the velocity of carriers is saturated to the drain region  4 , carriers flow toward the drain region  4  at a constant saturation velocity Vsat. In this velocity saturation region, the downward longitudinal electric field decreases with increasing proximity to the drain region  4  whereas the lateral electric field increases. Therefore, the electric field intensity in the velocity saturation region exhibits a two-dimensional distribution. As a result, a carrier flow path  7  from the point  6  at which the velocity of carriers is saturated to the drain region  4  extends as deep as drain junction depth Xj from the surface of the silicon substrate  1 . In part of the velocity saturation region closer to the drain region  4 , the direction of the longitudinal electric field is reversed, thus forming a carrier-depletion region  8 .  \\n      Drain junction depth Xj appears in Equation (7) of the conventional model regarding characteristic length lc used in Equation (6) of the substrate current model because it is assumed that the depth at which the longitudinal electric field in the drain end can be disregarded is equal to drain junction depth Xj. However, from the consideration based on the carrier distribution in the velocity saturation region, the depth at which the longitudinal electric field in the drain end can be disregarded is not drain junction depth Xj but the depth Xd of the carrier-depletion region  8 . This is because the lateral electric field is dominant in the carrier flow path  7  and thus the longitudinal electric field therein can be disregarded. In view of this, in the inventive substrate current model, characteristic length lc is modeled as the following equation (9): \\n \\n lc =(\\u03b5 Si   \\u00b7Tox\\u00b7Xd/\\u03b5   ox ) 1/2 \\u2003\\u2003(9) \\n \\n      In the inventive substrate current model, the dependence of lc and Ai in Equation (6) on gate voltage Vgs and drain voltage Vds is modeled as described below. Suppose the carrier density in the carrier flow path  7  is constant in the drain end and this carrier density is n c (/cm 3 ). In addition, suppose the carrier density is approximately zero in the carrier-depletion region  8  and an upward longitudinal electric field corresponding to the charge density equal to the decreased amount of the carrier density, \\u2212n c , occurs. This upward longitudinal electric field is generated by positive charge in the drain region  4 . Based on these suppositions, the longitudinal electric field in the drain end is expressed by the following equation (10): \\n \\n Ex (0)=\\u2212 q\\u00b7n   c   \\u00b7Xd/\\u03b5   Si \\u2003\\u2003(10) \\n          where q is the elementary charge, n c  is the carrier density in the carrier flow path  7 , Xd is the depth of the carrier-depletion region  8  and \\u03b5 Si  is the dielectric constant of silicon. As described above, the lateral electric field is dominant in the carrier flow path  7  and thus the longitudinal electric field can be disregarded, so that the potential \\u00f8 in the carrier flow path  7  is constant in the depth direction (i.e., x direction). This potential is equal to that at depth Xd in the carrier-depletion region  8 . Suppose this potential is \\u00f8(Xd), surface potential \\u00f8(0) in the drain end given by Equation (10) is given by the following equation (11): \\n \\n\\u00f8(0)=\\u00f8( Xd )\\u2212 q\\u00b7n\\u00b7n   c   Xd   2 /2\\u03b5 Si \\u2003\\u2003(11) \\n       \\n\\n       FIG. 2  shows a distribution of the potential in the longitudinal direction in the drain end. As shown in  FIG. 2 , potential \\u00f8 in the carrier flow path  7  (where X&gt;Xd) is constant in the longitudinal direction (i.e., depth direction) and is equal to potential \\u00f8(Xd) at depth Xd in the carrier-depletion region  8 . On the other hand, potential \\u00f8 decreases with increasing proximity to the surface in the carrier-depletion region  8  (where X\\u2266Xd). Surface potential \\u00f8(0) at the surface of the drain end is determined from Equation (11). Difference \\u00f8(0)\\u2212\\u00f8(Xd) between surface potential \\u00f8(0) and potential \\u00f8(Xd) at depth Xd in the carrier-depletion region  8  in the drain end approximates a primary expression regarding the gate-drain voltage Vgd (=Vgs\\u2212Vds). That is, the following equation (12) is established \\n \\u00f8(0)=\\u00f8( Xd )\\u2212( p   0 + p   1 \\u00b7 Vgd )\\u2003\\u2003(12)           where p 0  and p 1  are constants,        \\n      If Xd, \\u00f8(0) and \\u00f8(Xd) are removed from Equations (9), (11) and (12), the following equation (13) is established \\n \\n lc=[ 2\\u03b5 Si   3 /(\\u03b5 ox   2   \\u00b7q\\u00b7n   c )] 1/4 \\u00b7( p   0 + p   1 \\u00b7 Vgd ) 1/4 \\u00b7( Tox ) 1/2 =( lc   0 + lc   1 \\u00b7 Vgd ) 1/4 \\u00b7( Tox ) 1/2 \\u2003\\u2003(13) \\n          where new parameters lc 0  and lc 1  are introduced. These parameters are respectively expressed by the following equations (14-1) and (14-2): \\n \\n lc   0 =[2\\u03b5 Si   3 /(\\u03b5 ox   2   \\u00b7q\\u00b7n   c )]\\u00b7 p   0 \\u2003\\u2003(14-1) \\n \\n lc   1 =[2\\u03b5 Si   3 /(\\u03b5 ox   2   \\u00b7q\\u00b7n   c )]\\u00b7 p   1 \\u2003\\u2003(14-2) \\n       \\n\\n      Parameters lc 0  and lc 1  are expressed using the same symbols as parameters lc 0  and lc 1  in Equation (8) of the conventional substrate current model but are different from lc 0  and lc 1  in Equation (8).  \\n      As described above, in the inventive substrate current model, lc in Equation (6) is modeled using Equation (13) including parameters lc 0  and lc 1  given by Equations (14-1) and (14-2), respectively.  \\n      On the other hand, in the inventive substrate current model, Ai in Equation (6) is modeled in the following manner. According to a research done by the present inventor, Ai is not such a constant as that used in a conventional technique but a function of the carrier density in the surface of a silicon substrate. The carrier density in the silicon substrate surface is a function of surface potential \\u00f8(0), so that Ai is assumed to be a function of gate-drain voltage Vgd and is expressed by, for example, the following equation (15): \\n \\n Ai=Ai   0 \\u00b7( lc   0 + lc   1 \\u00b7 Vgd ) Ai1 \\u2003\\u2003(15) \\n          where Ai 0  and Ai 1  are parameters.        \\n\\n      In the method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a MOS transistor using the substrate current model according to the present invention, Equations (13) and (15) of the inventive model regarding lc and Ai in Equation (6) of the substrate current model are used to simulate hot-carrier degradation.  \\n      Hereinafter, a method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a MOS transistor using the inventive substrate current model, i.e., a method for simulating the reliability of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention, will be described.  \\n      First, a method for extracting parameters (model parameters) lc 0 , lc 1 , Ai 0  and Ai 1  in the inventive substrate current model from experimental data will be described specifically.  \\n       FIG. 3  is a graph for explaining the method for extracting the model parameters of the inventive substrate current model from experimental data. Specifically,  FIG. 3  is a plot for determining model parameters lc 0 , lc 1 , Ai 0  and Ai 1  included in Equations (13) and (15) of the inventive model and for showing parameters Ai and lc in Equation (6) of the conventional substrate current model. In  FIG. 3 , the ordinate indicates Isub/(Id\\u00b7(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)) obtained by dividing ratio I sub /Id, i.e., the ratio of substrate current Isub to drain current Id, by difference Vds\\u2212Vdsat between drain voltage Vds and saturation drain voltage Vdsat using a log scale whereas the abscissa indicates the reciprocal 1/(Vds\\u2212Vdsat) of difference Vds\\u2212Vdsat between drain voltage Vds and saturation drain voltage Vdsat. Reference numeral  11  denotes data regarding measurement points based on Isub measurement and Id measurement at respective gate-drain voltages Vgd (=Vgs\\u2212Vds) of a MOS transistor. Reference numeral  12  denotes lines fitted to the data regarding the measurement points at respective gate-drain voltages Vgd. Drain current Id and substrate current Isub of a MOS transistor are measured by varying gate voltage Vgs under four conditions of drain voltage Vds (=2.3V, 2.7V, 3.1V and 3.5V.) In this case, substrate voltage vbs is 0V. From the measurement results on drain current Id and substrate current Isub, saturation drain voltage Vdsat is obtained as a function of gate voltage Vgs. An example of a method for determining saturation drain voltage Vdsat is described in reference  5  mentioned above. Then, Isub/(Id\\u00b7(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)) and 1/(Vds\\u2212Vdsat) are obtained for each of the measurement points using saturation drain voltage Vdsat. The results are plotted for each of the gate-drain voltages Vgd such that the ordinate indicates Isub/(Id\\u00b7(Vds\\u2212Vdsat)) based on a log scale and the abscissa indicates 1/(Vds\\u2212Vdsat). In  FIG. 3 , seven gate-drain voltages Vgd, i.e., \\u22122.5V, \\u22122.0V, \\u22121.5V, \\u22121.0V, \\u22120.5V, 0.0V and 0.5V), are plotted for simplicity. However, in practice, the plotting is performed on a wider range of Vgd.  \\n      When the coordinate axes are set in the manner described above, i.e., natural logarithms are plotted on the ordinate, according to Equation (6), the intercepts (y-axis intercepts) of the lines fitted to the data regarding the measurement points are ln (Ai/Bi) (where ln is a natural logarithm) and the slopes of the respective lines are \\u2212Bi\\u00b7lc. Accordingly, lc and Ai at gate-drain voltages Vgd are obtained from ln(Ai/Bi) and \\u2212Bi\\u00b7lc. For the data regarding the measurement points at gate-drain voltages Vgd, parameters lc 0  and lc 1  in Equation (13) and parameters Ai 0  and Ai 1  in Equation (15) are determined with a method of least squares.  \\n       FIG. 4A  shows a method for determining parameters lc 0  and lc 1  in Equation (13) from the data regarding measurement points at gate-drain voltages Vgd by a method of least squares.  FIG. 4B  shows a method for determining parameters Ai 0  and Ai 1  in Equation (15) from the data regarding measurement points at gate-drain voltages Vgd by a method of least squares.  \\n      In  FIG. 4A , data is plotted in such a manner that the ordinate indicates the fourth power of lc (lc 4 ) thus obtained with respect to Vgd and the abscissa indicates gate-drain voltage Vgd. In  FIG. 4A , reference numeral  13  denotes plotted data and reference numeral  14  denotes a line fitted to the data by a method of least squares. From Equation (13), the intercept (y-axis intercept) of the line  14  is lc 0 \\u00b7Tox 2  and the slope of the line is lc 1 \\u00b7Tox 2  in the plot of \\u201clc 4 \\u201d with respect to \\u201cVgd\\u201d. Accordingly, lc 0  and lc 1  are determined from lc 0 \\u00b7Tox 2  and lc 1 \\u00b7Tox 2 . Specifically, if a MOS transistor in which the gate oxide film thickness Tox is 5.0 nm is used in this embodiment, lc 0 =1.13\\u00d710 \\u22128  cm 2  and lc 1 =\\u22121.07\\u00d710 \\u22128  cm 2 /V are obtained as parameters lc 0  and lc 1 , respectively.  \\n      In  FIG. 4B , data is plotted in such a manner that the ordinate indicates Ai thus obtained with respect to Vgd based on a log scale and the abscissa indicates (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) using parameters lc 0  and lc 1  thus obtained based on a log scale. In  FIG. 4B , reference numeral  15  denotes plotted data and the reference numeral  16  denotes a line fitted to the data by a method of least square. From Equation (15), the intercept of the line  16  is ln (Ai 0 ) (where ln is a natural logarithm) and the slope of the line is Ai 1  in the plot of \\u201clog scale for Ai\\u201d with respect to \\u201clog scale for (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd)\\u201d, i.e., in the plot in which natural logarithms are used for both the ordinate and the abscissa. Accordingly, parameters Ai 0  and Ai 1  are obtained from these values. Specifically, if a MOS transistor in which the gate oxide film thickness Tox is 5.0 nm is used in this embodiment, Ai 0 =4.60\\u00d710 18 /cm and Ai 1 =1.583 are obtained as parameters Ai 0  and Ai 1 .  \\n       FIGS. 5A and 5B  are graphs each showing the degree of agreement between the calculated values of substrate current Isub using the parameters obtained in the manner described above and actually-measured values of substrate current Isub. Specifically,  FIGS. 5A and 5B  show comparison between the calculated values of substrate current Isub obtained by using Equation (6) of the conventional substrate current model and Equations (13) and (15) of the inventive substrate current model and the actually-measured values of substrate current Isub, using drain voltage Vds as a parameter. In  FIG. 5A , the ordinate indicates substrate current Isub using a log scale and the abscissa indicates gate voltage Vgs. Reference numeral  17  denotes actually-measured values of substrate current Isub and reference numeral  18  denotes calculation results on substrate current Isub obtained by using the parameters determined from the graphs shown in  FIGS. 3 and 4  and Equations (6), (13) and (15). In the same way, in  FIG. 5B , the ordinate indicates substrate current Isub and the abscissa indicates gate voltage Vgs. Reference numeral  19  denotes actually-measured values of substrate current Isub and reference numeral  20  denotes calculation results on substrate current Isub obtained by using the parameters determined from the graphs shown in  FIGS. 3 and 4  and Equations (6), (13) and (15).  \\n      As shown in  FIGS. 5A and 5B , deviation of the calculation results on substrate current Isub in the inventive substrate current model from the actually-measured values is small. This deviation is smaller than that in the conventional substrate current model especially when drain voltage Vds is low.  \\n      To determine parameters lc 0 , lc 1 , Ai 0  and Ai 1  in Equations (13) and (15), a method of performing numerical calculation equivalent to the plotting, a method of optimizing parameters by numerical repetitive calculation using a method of nonlinear least squares, or a method in which these methods are combined, for example, can be used, instead of the method of using a plot as described above. If part or the all of the methods for determining parameters lc 0 , lc 1 , Ai 0  and Ai 1  are incorporated in parameter-extracting software as programs, part of or the entire calculation of parameters lc 0 , lc 1 , Ai 0  and Ai 1  can be automated.  \\n       FIG. 6  is a flowchart showing a procedure of a method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a circuit using the inventive substrate current model, i.e., showing a procedure of a method for simulating the reliability of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method shown in  FIG. 6  includes steps S 11  through S 14  for allowing a reliability simulator using a programmed computer, for example, to simulate hot-carrier degradation in a transistor according to Equations (4) through (6), (13) and (15).  \\n      First, at step S 11 , fresh drain current Id is simulated using transistor parameters before stressing which have been extracted beforehand.  \\n      Next, at step S 12 , substrate current Isub is simulated based on Equations (6), (13) and (15) of a substrate current model and parameters lc 0 , lc 1 , Ai 0  and Ai 1  determined by the method described with reference to  FIGS. 3 and 4 .  \\n      Then, at step S 13 , Age, which indicates degradation of a transistor based on Equation (5), is calculated by performing time integration on the function of drain current Id and substrate current Isub in a circuit. In this calculation, drain current Id simulated at step S 11  and substrate current Isub simulated at step S 12  are used.  \\n      Thereafter, at step S 14 , hot-carrier degradation (specifically drain current Id\\u2032 after degradation) in a transistor is simulated using Equation (4) based on Age calculated at step S 13 .  \\n      As already described above, Equations (13) and (15) of the substrate current model (equations regarding terminal voltage dependence) of the present invention for determining lc and Ai in Equation (6) of the substrate current model shows a function of gate-drain voltage Vgd and has a physical bases, unlike the conventional equation (8) showing dependence of lc on the drain voltage, for example. Accordingly, as shown in  FIGS. 5A and 5B , the calculation results on substrate current Isub agree with actually-measured values with high accuracy. The accuracy is higher than that in the conventional substrate current model especially when drain voltage Vds is low.  \\n      Specifically, an accurate simulation of hot-carrier degradation is needed when drain voltage Vds is lower than that during stressing, i.e., at about a level in actual use. On the other band, in the substrate current model of the present invention, the accuracy is high when drain voltage Vds is low. Consequently, Age is calculated with high accuracy at step S 13  in the flowchart shown in  FIG. 6  in the method for simulating hot-carrier degradation in a MOS transistor, resulting in that accuracy in simulation of hot-carrier degradation in a transistor at step S 14  is greatly enhanced as compared to a conventional technique. This extends the application range of a technique for simulating hot-carrier degradation.  \\n      In this embodiment, as shown in Equation (13), characteristic length lc is expressed using a function which is proportional to (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) 1/4 . Alternatively, another function lc[lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd] of primary expression (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) regarding Vgd may be used instead.  \\n      In this embodiment, as shown in Equation (15), parameter Ai is expressed using a function proportional to (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) Ai1 . Alternatively, another function Ai[lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd] of primary expression (lc 0 +lc 1 \\u00b7Vgd) regarding Vgd may be used instead.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005226013-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"Converter modules for providing and receiving electric power through a single telephone wire-pair and related systems and methods.

No. 60/561,832, filed on Apr. 13, 2004, by Fontana, entitled \\u201cTelephone Pair Powering System with Unique Elements,\\u201d commonly assigned with the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. \\n    \\n    \\n     TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The present invention is directed, in general, to telecommunications power systems and, more specifically, to a system and method for providing and receiving electric power through telephone wire-pairs.  \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n      Optical fiber has, for several years, been used in telecommunication networks as \\u201cbackbones\\u201d to link central offices (COs) to one another. In contrast, however, ordinary twisted pairs of copper wire (\\u201cwire-pairs\\u201d) have continued to be used as \\u201clocal loops\\u201d to link the COs to customer premises.  \\n      Telecommunication companies have now begun the process of transitioning to optical fiber all the way out to customer premises so they can offer the same broadband access as do cable companies. However, unlike wire-pairs, optical fibers by their nature require each customer premises to have terminating equipment (\\u201ccustomer premises equipment\\u201d or CPE) so their optical signals can be converted to electrical signals.  \\n      Unfortunately, optical fibers are unsuited to convey the electric power the CPE requires to operate. The CPE must derive its electric power from a separate source. Of course, the CPE could be plugged into the commercial power grid at the customer premises. This is a satisfactory solution until the power grid fails. The CPE loses its source of power, and telecommunication services are interrupted until power is restored. Given the historical reliability of the nation&#39;s telecommunication system, this is unacceptable.  \\n      One approach to ensuring that power to CPE is maintained at the customer premises during power grid failures is to place an uninterruptible power supply (\\u201cUPS\\u201d) at the customer premises. Unfortunately, UPSs are battery-powered and must be monitored and maintained to ensure that they operate when needed.  \\n      The other approach is to provide power from the CO to each customer premises using the wire-pairs that the optical fibers superseded. Thus, the wire-pairs become conduits for electric power rather than for telephone conversations. The wire-pairs can provide power all the time or only during grid failures.  \\n      Although the latter approach avoids the need for UPSs, using wire-pairs for electric power brings its own complications. The second method historically has used bulk +/\\u2212130 to +/\\u2212190 volt (V) converters at the CO and bulk converters converting down to a voltage suitable for CPE at the customer premises. These relatively high voltages are necessary given the electrical resistance of the wire-pairs. However, to maintain safety, all wire-pairs used for local loops fall under Class 2 of the National Electrical Code (NEC), which establishes a 100 volt-ampere (VA) limit on the wire-pairs. Therefore, line-dedicated 130/190V current limiters must also be used at the CO to ensure that the 100 VA limit per twisted pair is not exceeded.  \\n      This poses several problems. First, the CO must create dedicated equipment rack space to house bulk 130V and/or 190V equipment. Rack space is in high demand. Second, bulk 130/190V power is more dangerous than the 48V power traditionally handled in the rack space and thus places an additional safety burden on both equipment design and field operation procedures. Third, current limiter behavior at the 100 VA limit is problematic at the CO, because limiting transistors contained in the current limiter may operate in their linear region, dissipating power rather than delivering it to the twisted pair. Fourth, the 100 VA limit at the customer premises is also problematic in that the CPE must always draw power below the 100 VA limit but also take into account resistive losses in the twisted pair. The bulk converters at the customer premises must therefore have current limited inputs. Finally, as power needs change from application to application, bulk converters or application-specific converters do not scale well.  \\n      Furthermore, the performance (transmission characteristics) of wire-pairs tends to change over time. Wire-pairs that are decades old tend to exhibit more resistive loss than newly installed wire-pairs. Prior art methods that employing bulk converters at the CO do not measure, and therefore compensate, for performance changes over time.  \\n      Accordingly, what is needed in the art is a system and method for providing electric power to telephone wire-pairs that meets one or more of the following objectives: does not require dedicated space, is safer than 130/190V power, does not waste power near the current limit or takes into account any changes in performance that may occur with respect to wire-pairs. What is further needed in the art is a system and method for receiving electric power from telephone wire-pairs that efficiently tailors itself to the power carrying capacity of the twisted pair. What is still further needed in the art is a system and method for providing and receiving electric power through telephone wire-pairs that scales well as application needs change.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a converter module for providing electric power to a single telephone wire-pair. In one embodiment, the converter module includes: (1) a DC/DC boost converter configured to receive input power from an existing power supply and an existing distribution bus at a central office and further configured to provide output power to the single wire-pair and (2) a current-limiting converter controller coupled to the DC/DC boost converter and configured to limit a current output of the DC/DC boost converter to the single wire-pair.  \\n      In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of providing electric power to a single telephone wire-pair.

Those skilled in the art should also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention.  \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      For a more complete understanding of the invention, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which:  \\n       FIG. 1  illustrates a block diagram of a prior art system for providing electric power to telephone wire-pairs;  \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a system for providing electric power to telephone wire-pairs constructed according to the principles of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 3  illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a DC/DC boost converter module constructed according to the principles of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4  illustrates an isometric view of one embodiment of the DC/DC boost converter module of  FIG. 3  wherein the module assumes the physical form of a conventional \\u201cbreaker\\u201d module;  \\n       FIG. 5  illustrates an isometric view of one embodiment of a plurality of DC/DC boost converter \\u201cbreaker\\u201d modules of  FIG. 3  installed in-line with a majority-load AC-DC converter;  \\n       FIG. 6  illustrates an isometric view of one embodiment of a plurality of DC/DC boost converter \\u201cbreaker\\u201d modules of  FIG. 3  with a grounding bar spanning and forming a common ground for the plurality;  \\n       FIG. 7  illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a DC/DC buck converter module constructed according to the principles of the present invention; and  \\n       FIG. 8  illustrates a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method of providing and receiving electric power through telephone wire-pairs carried out according to the principles of the present invention.  \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n      Before describing the FIGUREs in detail, some objectives pertaining to some embodiments of the present invention will be set forth.  \\n      First, the present invention introduces the broad concept of using the electrical and mechanical equipment that already exist in a CO. By the present invention, not only can the existing power supplies, buses and even racks and distribution panels find new use, the lower voltage (48V) carried in the existing distribution panels is safer to the personnel who have to maintain and operate the CO.  \\n      Because the existing equipment, buses and distribution panels carry a relatively low voltage (e.g., 48V), the present invention, in one aspect, employs a DC/DC boost converter that converts the relatively low voltage to one that is more appropriate for transmission over local-loop wire-pairs (e.g., 130/190V). The DC/DC boost converter provides protected power (which, in one embodiment is limited to 100 VA to comply with NEC Class 2) and provides its power to a single pair of telephone wires with no aggregation. A one-to-one correspondence exists between a specific boost converter and a specific pair of wires, greatly simplifying the proper delivery of power over the wires. More specifically, the one-to-one correspondence allows the power-carrying capability of each wire-pair to be optimized or maximized by matching current limit thresholds, offset by circuit tolerances, at each end of each wire-pair to avoid mistrips. The one-to-one correspondence also allows scaling to occur gradually; wire-pairs can be activated or deactivated one or a few at a time instead of necessarily in bulk.  \\n      The DC/DC boost converter may advantageously plug in to standard existing 48V circuit breaker slots. This physical form (colloquially called a \\u201cform factor\\u201d) allows existing racks and distribution panels to be used.  \\n      The present invention further introduces, in one aspect, a DC/DC buck converter on the receiving end at the customer premises. The DC/DC buck converter is preferably matched to its corresponding DC/DC boost converter (at the CO) such that the sourcing converter never operates in a current limit mode during a non-fault condition. Matching the two converters allows each specific wire-pair (having individual transmission characteristics) to be operated at maximum efficiency and safety.  \\n      The DC/DC buck converter may plug into a standard circuit breaker distribution slot. However, the physical form of the DC/DC buck converter is not perceived as being as important at the customer premises as it is at the CO.  \\n      Having described some objectives pertaining to some embodiments of the present invention, the FIGUREs will now be described in detail. Accordingly, referring initially to  FIG. 1 , illustrated is a block diagram of a prior art system for providing electric power to telephone wire-pairs.  FIG. 1  highlights the sheer inefficiency and complexity that the prior art approach offered. A plurality of CPE is shown: CPE 1   110   a , CPE 2   110   b , CPE 3   110   c , CPE 4   110   d , CPE 5   110   e  and CPE 6   110   f . A CO  120  is also shown.  \\n      Each of the CPEs  110   a ,  110   b ,  110   c ,  110   d ,  110   e ,  110   f  represents a different physical location and is coupled to the CO  120  by distinct corresponding wire-pairs  130   a ,  130   b ,  130   c ,  130   d ,  130   e ,  130   f . The wire-pairs  130   a ,  130   b ,  130   c ,  130   d ,  130   e ,  130   f  each have different electrical transmission characteristics that, to complicate matters further, can change over time as wires age and repairs are made.  \\n      The CO  120  is illustrated as having separate high voltage buses, specifically, a +/\\u2212130V bus  140   a  and a +/\\u2212190V bus  140   b . The CO  120  further contains a dedicated +/\\u2212130V bulk power supply  150   a  a coupled to the +/\\u2212130V bus  140   a  and a dedicated +/\\u2212190V bulk power supply  150   b  coupled to the +/\\u2212190V bus  140   b.    \\n      The dedicated +/\\u2212130V bulk power supply  150  and the +/\\u2212130V bus  140   a  ostensibly occupy one or more dedicated 130 v racks (not shown). The dedicated +/\\u2212190V bulk power supply  150   b  and the +/\\u2212190V bus  140   b  ostensibly occupy one or more further dedicated 190V racks (not shown) that are wholly separate from the 130V racks. These dedicated racks consume substantial CO  120  space.  \\n      Bulk current limiter cards are associated with each of the +/\\u2212130V bus  140   a  and the +/\\u2212190V bus  140   b .  FIG. 1  specifically shows two bulk current limiter cards  160   a ,  160   b  coupled to the +/\\u2212130V bus  140   a  and one bulk current limiter card  160   c  coupled to the +/\\u2212190V bus  140   b . The bulk current limiter card  160   a  is coupled to two wire-pairs, namely the wire-pair  130   a  and the wire-pair  130   b . In a like manner, the bulk current limiter card  160   b  is coupled to the wire-pair  130   c  and the wire-pair  130   e , and the bulk current limiter card  160   c  is coupled to the wire-pair  130   d  and the wire-pair  130   f.    \\n       FIG. 1  does not show the existing 48V power supplies, buses and racks, distribution panels and backup battery strings that the CO  120  already has in place. These must either remain in place to service wire-pairs that remain in service for bearing voice traffic or must be disposed of to make room for what  FIG. 1  does show.  \\n      At least three significant disadvantages are apparent from an examination of the prior art system of  FIG. 1 . First, new infrastructure (power supplies, buses and racks must be purchased and installed and occupy space in the CO  120 . Second, the new infrastructure uses unprotected high voltage power, which represents a significant safety hazard. And third, each bulk current limiter card  160   a ,  160   b ,  160   c  must limit current on multiple wire-pairs, which is a complex and potentially inefficient or ineffective function.  \\n      Turning now to  FIG. 2 , illustrated is a block diagram of one embodiment of a system for providing electric power to telephone wire-pairs constructed according to the principles of the present invention.  \\n      The CPE  110   a ,  110   b ,  110   c ,  110   d ,  110   e ,  110   f  are still coupled to the CO  120  by corresponding wire-pairs  130   a ,  130   b ,  130   c ,  130   d ,  130   e ,  130   f . However, gone are the dedicated +/\\u2212130V bus  140   a , the +/\\u2212190V bus  140   b , +/\\u2212130V bulk power supply  150   a , +/\\u2212190V bulk power supply  150   b  and bulk current limiter cards  160   a ,  160   b ,  160   c . Instead, the existing 48V distribution bus  240  of the CO  120  is coupled to an existing 48V power supply  250   a  and an existing 48V backup battery string  250   b . A plurality of DC/DC boost converter modules  260   a ,  260   b ,  260   c ,  260   d ,  260   e ,  260   f  are coupled to the existing 48V distribution bus  240  and the wire-pairs  130   a ,  130   b ,  130   c ,  130   d ,  130   e ,  130   f  in a one-to-one correspondence. In the embodiment of  FIG. 2 , the DC/DC boost converter modules  260   a ,  260   b ,  260   c ,  260   d ,  260   e ,  260   f  assume the physical form of conventional \\u201cbreaker\\u201d modules that fit within an existing 48V distribution panel (not shown) that contains the existing 48V distribution bus  240 .  \\n      Turning now to  FIG. 3 , illustrated is a block diagram of one embodiment of a DC/DC boost converter module (e.g., the converter module  260   a  of  FIG. 2 ) constructed according to the principles of the present invention. Electrically, the illustrated embodiment of the converter module  260   a  is characterized by a current-limited input that transfers as much power as possible through a wire-pair without putting the boost converter into current or power limit modes.  \\n      The converter module  260   a  includes a DC/DC boost converter  310 , which, in the illustrated embodiment is transformer-isolated. The DC/DC boost converter  310  is configured to receive input power from an existing power supply via an existing distribution bus (the 48V distribution bus  240  in the illustrated embodiment). The DC/DC boost converter  310  is further configured to provide output power to a single wire-pair (e.g., the wire-pair  330 ). Two or more wire-pairs may, of course, be used in parallel instead of a single wire-pair, to reduce losses and allow the local loop to be longer. The definition of \\u201cwire-pair\\u201d therefore includes multiple parallel pairs that act as a single wire-pair.  \\n      The DC/DC boost converter  310  may be of conventional topology. In the illustrated embodiment, the DC/DC boost converter  310  converts a 48V input to a positive or negative 130V or positive or negative 190V output (which is at least about 60V). Those skilled in the pertinent art understand the structure and function of DC/DC boost converters suitable for operating as the DC/DC boost converter  310 .  \\n      The converter module  260   a  further includes a current-limiting converter controller  320 . The current-limiting converter controller  320  is coupled to the DC/DC boost converter  310  and is configured to limit a current output of the DC/DC boost converter  310  to the single wire-pair  330 .  \\n      The current-limiting converter controller  320  may be of conventional topology. In the illustrated embodiment, the current-limiting converter controller  320  controls the operation of the DC/DC boost converter to maintain the desired output voltage without exceeding the 100 VA limit NEC Class 2 imposes on the wire-pair  330 . Those skilled in the pertinent art understand the structure and function of current-limiting converter controllers suitable for operating as the current-limiting converter controller  320 .  \\n      Turning now to  FIG. 4 , illustrated is an isometric view of one embodiment of the converter module  260   a  of  FIG. 3  wherein the converter module  260   a  assumes the physical form of a conventional \\u201cbreaker\\u201d module.  \\n      The converter module  260   a  includes a housing  400 . The housing  400  contains the DC/DC boost converter and the current-limiting converter controller (not shown). Input terminals  410 ,  420  are associated with one surface (e.g., a rear surface) of the housing  400 . The input terminals  410  are coupled to the DC/DC boost converter located in the housing  400 . An alarm contact  430  provides status information about the converter module that can be remotely monitored. A status-indicating light  440  is coupled to the housing  400  (e.g., a front surface of the housing  400 ). The status-indicating light  440  is configured to display status information with respect to the converter module. Those skilled in the pertinent art are familiar with the kinds of status information that may be provided via the alarm contact  430  or the status-indicating light  440 . For example, the status-indicating light  440  may indicate when a DC/DC buck converter associated with the converter module is unable to maintain a desired output voltage without exceeding the input current limit. This may indicate that output voltages may need to be increased. This operation will be described in greater detail below.  \\n      Output terminals  450  are associated with a surface of the housing that is distal from the surface of the housing  400  on which the input terminals  410 ,  420  are located. The output terminals  450  are coupled to the DC/DC boost converter within the housing  400 . In the illustrated embodiment, the output terminals  450  are located on the front surface of the housing  400 , allowing access to be gained to them when the converter module is mounted in a distribution panel. Of course, the present invention does not restrict where the output terminals  450  may be located.  \\n      Turning now to  FIG. 5 , illustrated is an isometric view of one embodiment of a plurality of DC/DC boost converter \\u201cbreaker\\u201d modules of  FIG. 3  installed in-line with a majority-load AC-DC converter.  FIG. 5  is presented primarily for the purpose of illustrating a plurality of converter modules  260   a ,  260   b ,  260   c ,  260   d ,  260   e  mounted side-by-side as would be the case in a conventional distribution panel.  FIG. 5  also shows an AC/DC converter  510 . The AC/DC converter  510  may be configured to carry a load during heat exchange startup and other surge loading conditions that occur only when AC grid-powered load equipment is operational. Since the AC/DC converter  510  is not necessarily limited to 100 VA, it may be bigger, perhaps in the kilowatt range.  \\n      Turning now to  FIG. 6 , illustrated is an isometric view of one embodiment of a plurality of DC/DC boost converter \\u201cbreaker\\u201d modules of  FIG. 3  with a grounding bar spanning and forming a common ground for the plurality.  FIG. 6  is presented primarily for the purpose of illustrating a plurality of converter modules  260   a ,  260   b ,  260   c ,  260   d ,  260   e  mounted side-by-side as in  FIG. 5 , but this time including a grounding bar  610 . The grounding bar  610  spans and provides a common ground for converter modules  260   a ,  260   b ,  260   c ,  260   d ,  260   e.    \\n      The grounding bar  610  may be located in the arc vent space available on a conventional distribution panel. The grounding bar  610  allows for lightning protection circuitry to operate where the wire-pairs (not shown) enter the converter modules  260   a ,  260   b ,  260   c ,  260   d ,  260   e . Traditional threaded fasteners may be used to couple the grounding bar  610  to the various converter modules  260   a ,  260   b ,  260   c ,  260   d ,  260   e . Other implementations may use a simple low-profile wipe connection to a substantially flat grounding bar  610 .  \\n      Turning now to  FIG. 7 , illustrated is a block diagram of one embodiment of a DC/DC buck converter module constructed according to the principles of the present invention. The DC/DC buck converter module is configured to receive electric power from telephone wire-pairs.  \\n      The DC/DC buck converter module includes a DC/DC buck converter  710 , which, in the illustrated embodiment is transformer-isolated. The DC/DC buck converter  710  is configured to receive input power from a wire-pair  330 . The DC/DC buck converter  710  is further configured to provide output power to CPE  760 . Those skilled in the pertinent art understand the structure and function of DC/DC buck converters suitable for operating as the DC/DC buck converter  710 .  \\n      A converter controller  720  is coupled to the DC/DC buck converter  710 . The converter controller  720  is configured to limit a current input of the DC/DC buck converter  710  from the wire-pair  330 . Electrically, the converter controller  720  is characterized by a current limited input that transfers as much power as possible through the wire-pair  330  without putting the DC/DC boost converter at the CO into a current or power limit mode. Those skilled in the pertinent art understand the structure and function of converter controllers suitable for operating as the converter controller  720 .  \\n      An open-circuit voltage detector  730  is coupled to the wire-pair  330 . The open-circuit voltage detector  730  is configured to detect an open-circuit voltage of the wire-pair  330 .  \\n      A current limit calculator  740  is coupled to the open-circuit voltage detector  730  and the converter controller  720 . The current limit calculator  740  is configured to determine an input current limit based on the open-circuit voltage detected by the open-circuit voltage detector  730 .  \\n      An undervoltage signaling circuit  750  is coupled to the current-limit calculator  740  and the converter controller  720 . The undervoltage signaling circuit  750  is configured to cause the converter controller  720  to generate a signal on the wire-pair  330  indicating that the DC/DC buck converter  710  is unable to maintain a desired output voltage without exceeding the input current limit.  \\n      In the illustrated embodiment, the converter controller  720 , the open-circuit voltage detector  730 , the current-limit calculator  740  and the undervoltage signaling circuit  750  cooperate as follows. After the open-circuit voltage detector  730  has measured the open circuit voltage of the wire-pair  330  and the converter controller  720  has set its input current limit to keep the DC/DC boost converter (e.g.,  260   a  of  FIG. 2 ) at the CO below the 100 VA limit, the converter controller  720  determines if the output voltage of the DC/DC buck converter  710  is within design limits. If the DC/DC buck converter  710  is unable to maintain the desired output voltage without exceeding the calculated input current limit, the undervoltage signaling circuit  750  causes the converter controller  720  to control the DC/DC buck converter  710  such that it intermittently short-circuits the wire-pair  330  in a signaling manner and thereby communicates to the DC/DC boost converter (e.g.,  260   a  of  FIG. 2 ). In the illustrated embodiment, the DC/DC boost converter (e.g.,  260   a  of  FIG. 2 ) responds by shifting into a current limit mode of operation.  \\n      The above is a relatively simple communication method. In alternative embodiments, communication may be effected by transmitting radio frequency signals over the wire-pair or by a separate channel (e.g., a wireless or optical link). With such more sophisticated communication, the present invention encompasses transmission of more detailed information regarding the operation of the buck converter module or the boost converter module from one to the other.  \\n      Turning back briefly to  FIG. 4 , the status-indicating light  440  can display the signaling to CO personnel. The CO personnel could interpret the signaling as a need for additional powering circuits or a higher output voltage. The CO personnel could swap the converter module for one having a higher output voltage. Alternatively, the CO personnel could select a higher drive voltage by manually flipping a switch on a dual- or multiple-output voltage converter module. The converter module could be provided with an auto-adjust function (e.g., trying \\u2212130 volts first; if that does not work, \\u2212190V; if that does not work, +/\\u2212130V; and if that does not work, +/\\u2212190V), thereby eliminating a need for the CO personnel to intervene. In alternative embodiments, the process of monitoring the converter modules may be automated by employing a computer network to remotely detect current-limit operation.  \\n      Other signaling information may include confirmation of output voltage by the DC/DC buck converter  710 . This supports efficient power conversion by the DC/DC buck converter  710  by having multiple wire-pairs driving multiple DC/DC buck converters to provide power at end-use voltages, for example redundant converters providing 3.3V or redundant converters providing 48V.  \\n      The benefits are rapid provisioning and configuration of power circuits by field personnel. One end of a given wire-pair can be worked on at one time. Real-time feedback about the performance (e.g., resistive loss) of real installed wire-pairs, that have been in the field for an extended period of time, can be received. The signaling can also allow personnel to properly configure redundant circuits.  \\n      In one embodiment of the present invention, the converter module at the customer premises may include a housing containing the DC/DC buck converter  710  and the converter controller  720  and having a breaker module physical form as  FIG. 4  illustrates.  \\n      Turning now to  FIG. 8 , illustrated is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method of providing and receiving electric power through telephone wire-pairs carried out according to the principles of the present invention.  \\n      The method begins in a start step  810  when it is desired to transmit power from a CO to CPE via a wire-pair. In a step  820 , input power is received into a DC/DC boost converter from an existing power supply and an existing distribution bus at a CO. In a step  830 , the DC/DC boost converter is employed to provide output power to the single wire-pair. In a step  840 , the DC/DC boost converter is controlled to limit a current output of the DC/DC boost converter to the single wire-pair. In a step  850  input power is received into a DC/DC buck converter located proximate the CPE from the wire-pair. In a step  860 , the DC/DC buck converter is employed to provide output power to the CPE. In a step  870 , the DC/DC buck converter is controlled to limit a current input of the DC/DC buck converter from the wire-pair. The method ends in a step  880 .  \\n      Although the present invention has been described in detail, those skilled in the art should understand that they can make various changes, substitutions and alterations herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2005226093-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A rubber kneading machine obviates an operator having to touch rubber on a rotating roll surface to perform a rubber kneading operation, permits unattended operation, is intrinsically safe, improves a rubber kneading process productivity, secures stable quality of kneaded rubber, and allows a closed rubber supplying mechanism to be easily opened and exposed for easy cleaning.

The present invention relates to an open type rubber kneading machine adapted to perform finish kneading on rubber blocks kneaded by a closed type rubber kneading machine or to knead with an added vulcanizing agent and roll.  \\n     BACKGROUND ART  \\n      A conventionally known open type rubber kneading machine is generally a twin-roll machine. The twin-roll machine is disposed such that two roll shafts are parallel in a horizontal-plane and their rolling surfaces are close to each other. Raw material rubber is fed between rolls from above while rotatively driving the two rolls. The two rolls are rotated at different speeds while being pressed into contact so as to apply shearing action to the rubber, thereby imparting plasticizing and grinding effect. An operator manually cuts apart the rubber wound around the rolls on the operating side by a cutter and winds it up or moves it to one side of the rolls by hand so as to facilitate mixing in a batch. This is because merely applying the shearing force to the rubber wound on the rolls results in uneven kneading action in the batch.  \\n      Thus, in the aforesaid publicly known rubber kneading machine, it is possible to accomplish even mixing of rubber in a batch by cutting rubber on a pair of rolls that are horizontally and closely disposed and rotated. For an operator, however, it is unsafe to work on rubber, which unavoidably includes contact with rotating rolls. The operation involves great danger, frequently causing serious injuries of operators by getting their hands or fingers caught between the rolls.  \\n      Recently, a sheeting apparatus combining an extruder and rolls is being put to practical use to replace the aforesaid roll machine. In this apparatus, a pair of rolls is vertically disposed, and the outlet of a screw extruder is disposed closely to the rolls so as to roll rubber into a rubber sheet by the pair of rolls. This apparatus, however, merely has a function for pushing kneaded rubber into the rolls from the screw extruder to form it into a sheet by one passage through the rolls. It has been ascertained that effect of finish kneading or mixing a vulcanizing agent cannot be obtained even when a circulation belt conveyor is provided to perform circulation kneading. In a process requiring such an operation, another twin-roll machine must be installed.  \\n      As may be understood from the description above, a rubber kneading machine is required to ensure efficient kneading operation and safety. In the aforesaid twin-roll rubber kneading machine, the quality of kneaded rubber depends on kneading action and skill of individual operators. The operators manually cut loose or wind up rubber wound around the surfaces of rotating rolls. This operation is not only painstaking but extremely dangerous.  \\n      Hence, there has been a demand for making it possible to mechanically perform the operation requiring skill without human aid. No equipment capable of performing such an operation has been developed. If production equipment performing such a rubber kneading operation is developed, then it will be possible to relieve fatigue, ensure safety, and secure uniform quality by standardizing operations.  \\n      On the other hand, if a rubber kneading machine is constructed to provide efficient kneading operation and high safety required by users, then the closeness of the rubber kneading machine itself is enhanced. This would require time-consuming cleaning of the interior of the rubber kneading machine to prevent a different material from being mixed in whenever a rubber with a different composition is used. In addition, the construction would make it difficult to perform thorough visual check after cleaning.  \\n      In this respect, the conventional open type rubber kneading machine permits relatively easy cleaning, whereas it markedly lacks in safety measures for operators, since it is an open type. In the aforesaid sheeting apparatus, rolls are moved to provide a gap between a distal end of a screw and the rolls, and the rolls are moved far apart so as to scrape out remaining material from an extrusion cylinder of the screw extruder, or a hopper at the top of a proximal end of a screw is opened to inspect and clean the interior of the extrusion cylinder. It is difficult, however, to thoroughly clean the interior of the extrusion cylinder and to fully check cleaning results, because of the presence of two screws. Especially for colored food or rubber dough for pharmaceuticals, it is necessary to carry out thorough cleaning to prevent any different materials from being mixed in whenever a different color or composition is used. Hence, there has been a demand for a rubber kneading machine that permits easy cleaning of closed parts and checking of cleaning results while maintaining efficient kneading operation and high safety.  \\n     DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION  \\n      A technological object of the present invention is to provide, unlike the aforesaid conventional roll rubber kneading machine, an intrinsically safe rubber kneading machine that obviates the need for an operator to touch rubber on the surfaces of rotating rolls during a rubber kneading operation, and permits fully unattended operation, depending on the type of rubber.  \\n      Another technological object of the present invention is to provide a rubber kneading machine that makes it possible to achieve higher productivity in a rubber kneading process, stable quality of kneaded rubber, and a labor-saving process.  \\n      Yet another technological object of the present invention is to provide a rubber kneading machine that is capable of continuously performing efficient mixing and kneading operation and rolling operation with high dimensional accuracy, a screw extruder thereof being provided with a mechanism for releasing an extrusion cylinder so as to permit easy cleaning of closed parts and also easy checking of cleaning results, while maintaining high safety for operators.  \\n      A rubber kneading machine in accordance with the present invention to fulfill the aforesaid objects includes two horizontal rolls disposed vertically close to each other through the intermediary of an adjusting device for allowing the gap between an upper roll and a lower roll to be freely adjusted, rotatively driving means for rotating the rolls, and a screw extruder for supplying a rubber lump fed into a hopper at a proximal end to the rolls, wherein a circulating mechanism for kneading and mixing rubber that is formed by feeding a rubber sheet that has left the rolls to the hopper is constructed of a FFFFFwinding control means for selectively winding the rubber sheet onto the upper roll by differentiating the rotational speeds of the upper and lower rolls by a variable speed motor or a decelerator, and a carrying means for sending the rubber sheet peeled from the upper roll to the hopper.  \\n      A conveyor can be used as the carrying means in the rubber kneading machine. In this case, the belt conveyor is hung over the upper roll so as to guide a sheet from the rubber rolls onto the belt conveyor to feed it to the hopper.  \\n      As the carrying means, a scraper that is in contact with the upper roll at an upper level thereof, peels a rubber sheet wound thereon, and guides it to the hopper may be used. Furthermore, the carrying means may be constructed of a scraper that is in contact with the upper roll at an upper level thereof to peel off a rubber sheet wound thereon, and a conveyor for feeding the rubber sheet peeled by the scraper to the hopper.  \\n      In the rubber kneading machine having the aforesaid construction, a rubber lump fed into the hopper of the screw extruder is supplied between the upper and lower rolls by the screw extruder, rolled between these rolls, and sent out as a rubber sheet toward the side of the rolls opposite from the screw extruder. The rubber sheet is guided to the hopper of the extruder by the winding control means and the carrying means for the rubber sheet that constitute the rubber circulating mechanism, and then supplied again to the pair of rolls by the screw extruder.  \\n      As the carrying means, the aforesaid scraper, conveyor, or the like may be used. The rubber sheet rolled between the pair of rolls can be wound around the upper roll by setting a proper rotational speed by a variable speed driver connected to the upper roll and/or lower roll and by setting a proper difference in temperature between the upper and lower rolls. The rubber sheet is peeled from the roll by a scraper or the like and guided to the hopper of the screw extruder, or carried to the hopper by the conveyor or the like hung on the upper roll and fed to the rolls again. This operation is repeated to circulate the rubber, thus making it possible to secure stable quality of kneaded rubber.  \\n      After the circulation of rubber is started, the rubber kneading speed can be considerably increased by increasing the rotational speed of the rolls and the driving speed of the screw extruder. Differentiating the rotational speeds (numbers of revolutions) of the upper and lower rolls is effective not only for selecting the winding onto the upper roll but for kneading passing rubber while applying shearing action thereto also.  \\n      The rubber kneading machine having such a mechanism enables an operator to apply mechanical kneading action to rubber simply by performing easy and safe operation, such as only monitoring the machine or placing a leading end of a rubber sheet coming out of the pair of rolls onto the conveyor, so that the operator hardly touches rubber during the operation. Upon completion of kneading, the rubber sheet adhering to the upper roll and transferred toward the screw extruder is cut on the upper roll in the direction of the roll axis at the outlet side from the upper and lower rolls, and at the same time, the upper and lower rolls are synchronously rotated. This causes the rubber sheet to come off the upper roll. Hence, providing a receiving conveyor under the lower roll allows the rubber sheet to be fed onto the conveyor, so that it can be carried out of the system.  \\n      Especially because the operating side where an operator touches rubber during the operation is the side where a rubber sheet comes out from the pair of rolls, there is no danger of the operator fingers or hands being caught between the rolls. This makes the mechanism intrinsically safe.  \\n      In the rubber kneading machine described above, the screw extruder has two tapered screws that mesh each other and rotate, and an extrusion cylinder accommodating the two screws. Preferably, the extrusion cylinder has an elliptical or gourd-shaped section and is tapered in its axial direction.  \\n      In the rubber kneading machine, a horizontal rubber fall preventing plate in contact with the lower roll is provided between the upper and lower rolls and the distal end of a collet of the screw extruder. Walls are vertically provided on both sides of the rubber fall preventing plate so that the interval therebetween can be set freely. The space formed between the walls is used as a rubber reservoir, and a detector for detecting the amount of rubber in the reservoir is provided at an upper level of the rubber reservoir. Based on the amount of rubber in the reservoir detected by the detector, the numbers of revolutions of the screws can be adjusted.  \\n      It is effective to use the space formed by vertically installing the walls on both sides of the rubber fall preventing plate as a rubber compression passage, and a rotative plate for setting the sectional area of the rubber compression passage is provided at an upper level of the space such that it is in contact with the walls on both sides and its position is vertically adjustable so as to form a rubber lump into a sheet, which is supplied to the rolls. In this case, it is proper to provide, in the rubber reservoir formed at the outlet side of the rotative plate, a detector for detecting the amount of rubber in a rubber reservoir to make the numbers of revolutions of the screws adjustable on the basis of the amount of rubber in the reservoir detected by the detector, and to make an arrangement so as to permit banking of rubber in the space.  \\n      These arrangements allow rubber to be rotated or kneaded in the rubber reservoir, so that kneading effect can be enhanced.  \\n      In a preferred form of the present invention, an extrusion cylinder accommodating the screws in the screw extruder is constructed such that it can be attached to and detached from the screw extruder main body including the screws and a driving mechanism thereof, and roll frames supporting the upper and lower rolls and the distal end of the extrusion cylinder are constructed to be removable. A driving mechanism may be provided to drive the roll frames and the extrusion cylinder toward or away from each other, and to drive the extrusion cylinder and the screw extruder main body toward or away from each other.  \\n      In this case, it is proper to provide clamps for removably fastening the extrusion cylinder to the roll frames and the screw extruder main body, make it possible to drive the driving mechanism in a direction for moving the roll frames and the screw extruder main body toward or away from each other, dispose the screw extruder main body and a direct acting machine constituting the driving mechanism on a base, secure the frames on a carriage connected to the direct acting machine, and support the extrusion cylinder such that it can be moved on the carriage in the direction in which the frames are moved.  \\n      With this arrangement, if the extrusion cylinder is secured to the roll frames with the clamps, while the clamps between the extrusion cylinder and the screw extruder main body are removed to drive it away from the screw extruder main body by the driving mechanism, then the screws are drawn out of the extrusion cylinder. Meanwhile, if the clamps between the extrusion cylinder and the roll frames are removed, while the extrusion cylinder and the screw extruder main body are clamped, and the driving mechanism is driven in the similar manner, then the roll frames move away from the screw extruder. In other words, the screws can be inserted in and moved out of the extrusion cylinder and the roll frames and the screw extruder can be moved toward or away from each other by the single driving mechanism.  \\n      Furthermore, in the rubber kneading machine, it is possible to configure a mechanism in which, at the rubber outlet side of the upper roll, a retaining seat is provided for a cutter that is pressed into contact with the roll and slidable with respect to the roll surface so as to cut rubber in a parallel direction. In this case, it is effective to provide a mechanism for pressing the cutter into contact with the roll by a pneumatic cylinder for adjusting the travel in a roll gap and the level of pressure of contact to the roll surface.  \\n      The rubber kneading machine constructed as described above allows the rolls and the distal end of the extrusion cylinder to be cleaned easily and securely by moving the roll supporting frames and the extrusion cylinder away from each other, or allows the interior of the extrusion cylinder and the screws to be cleaned easily and securely by moving the extrusion cylinder and the screw extruder main body away from each other to expose the screws when, for example, changing the color or composition of a rubber dough, while maintaining high safety for an operator by its high level of closure.  \\n      The rubber kneading machine in accordance with the present invention described in detail above is intrinsically safe, because the rubber sheet outlet side of the rolls (the side where rolls  1  and  2  mesh each other and do not rotate) is the operating side, which is different from a conventional roll rubber kneading machine. Moreover, the rubber circulating mechanism that includes the carrying means for sending a rubber sheet sent out from between the upper and lower rolls to the hopper of the screw extruder is provided, so that an operator does not have to touch rubber on a rotating roll surface in performing a rubber kneading operation. Depending on the type of rubber, completely unattended operation is possible.  \\n      The kneading effect in the rubber kneading machine according to the present invention is marked particularly when the rotational speeds of the upper and lower rolls are differentiated. This arrangement applies high shearing to rubber passing through the upper and lower rolls. Properly setting the rubber reservoir formed in the valley between the distal end of the collet of the screw extruder and the rolls causes the rubber to rotate, leading to enhanced kneading effect.  \\n      Marked mixing and kneading effect is obtained by lowering the position where the rotative plate is fixed at the distal end of the collet of the screw extruder to feed a sheet-like rubber between the upper and lower rolls, as shown in a third embodiment.  \\n      Thus, it is possible for the rubber kneading machine according to the present invention to provide production equipment that permits improved productivity of a rubber kneading process, stable quality of kneaded rubber, safe operation, and laborsaving to be achieved.  \\n      Furthermore, the extrusion cylinder accommodating the screws in the screw extruder is removably installed to the screw extruder main body, the frames supporting the upper and lower rolls and the distal end of the extrusion cylinder are removable, and the driving mechanism is provided to drive the frames and the extrusion cylinder away from each other alternately or simultaneously, and to drive the extrusion cylinder and the screw extruder main body alternately or simultaneously away from each other. This arrangement allows the rolls and the distal end of the extrusion cylinder to be cleaned easily and securely. The interior of the extrusion cylinder and the screw can be cleaned easily and securely by moving the extrusion cylinder and the screw extruder main body apart from each other to expose the screws. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is a plan view of a rubber kneading machine according to a first embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 2  is a partial cutaway front view of the rubber kneading machine;  \\n       FIG. 3  is a plan view of a rubber kneading machine according to a second embodiment of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4  is a partial cutaway front view of the rubber kneading machine;  \\n       FIG. 5  is a partial cutaway front view showing a state wherein screws of the rubber kneading machine has been drawn out of an extrusion cylinder;  \\n       FIG. 6  is a partial cutaway front view showing a state wherein a gap is produced between frames and the extrusion cylinder of the rubber kneading machine;  \\n       FIG. 7  is a partial enlarged plan view showing clamps provided adjacently to frames of the rubber kneading machine;  \\n       FIG. 8  is a partial enlarged plan view showing a clamp provided on a screw extruder main body of the rubber kneading machine;  \\n       FIG. 9  is a front view of the clamp shown in  FIG. 8 ;  \\n       FIG. 10  is an enlarged side sectional view of an essential section for explaining a rubber reservoir of the screw extruder in the second embodiment;  \\n       FIG. 11  is an enlarged plan view of the essential section; and  \\n       FIG. 12  is a perspective view of an essential section showing a construction of a third embodiment of the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION  \\n       FIG. 1  and  FIG. 2  show a first embodiment of a rubber kneading machine in accordance with the present invention. The rubber kneading machine is basically provided with two horizontal rolls  1  and  2  disposed vertically close to each other and a screw extruder  3  for supplying a rubber lump fed into a hopper  4  to the rolls  1  and  2 .  \\n      The upper roll  1  and the lower roll  2  are vertically disposed so that they are parallel to each other between a pair of left and right frames  6   a  and  6   b  provided on a base  5 , and bearings  7   a,    7   b  and  8   a,    8   b  of both axial ends are supported by the frames. The bearings  7   a  and  7   b  of both axial ends of the upper roll  1  are fixedly supported by the frames  6   a  and  6   b.  The bearings  8   a  and  8   b  receiving both axial ends of the lower roll  2  are retained by the frames  6   a  and  6   b,  respectively, such that they are free to move up and down, and distal ends of screws  10   a  and  10   b  threadedly inserted in female screws  9   a  and  9   b  provided at bottoms of the frames  6   a  and  6   b  are abutted against bottom surfaces thereof to support them. The screws  10   a  and  10   b  are rotatively driven by driving devices  11  provided on the frames. These components constitute a gap adjusting mechanism for arbitrarily adjusting the gap between the paired rolls  1  and  2  by moving the lower roll  2  up or down.  \\n      Meanwhile, the shafts of the upper roll  1  and the lower roll  2  are connected to variable speed motors  15   a  and  15   b,  through the intermediary of decelerators  16   a  and  16   b,  as the means for rotatively driving the rolls. The rolls are rotatively driven in the direction for chewing rubber fed from the screw extruder  3 . Furthermore, the number of revolutions of the upper and lower rolls  1  and  2  can be arbitrarily set independently in the variable speed motors  15   a  and  15   b  or the decelerators  16   a  and  16   b.  Alternatively, however, a single motor connected to the upper roll  1  or the lower roll  2  may be used to cause the other roll to be rotated through the intermediary of a gear or the like, which is not shown. In this case, however, it is necessary to arbitrarily set the numbers of revolutions of both rolls independently in the decelerators connected to the shafts of the respective rolls.  \\n      The screw extruder  3  is equipped with two tapered screws  21   a  and  21   b  that mesh each other and rotate and an extrusion cylinder  20  accommodating the screws. The extrusion cylinder  20  has an elliptical or a gourd-shaped section, and is tapered in the axial direction, a collet  22  at the distal end being disposed between the upper roll  1  and the lower roll  2  disposed closely to each other. The hopper  4  widely opened upward for receiving large rubber blocks to be kneaded is provided at the proximal end of the extrusion cylinder  20 .  \\n      Conical gears  27   a  and  27   b  that intermesh with their screw shafts in a case  25  and rotatively supported by bearings  26   a  and  26   b  are provided at the proximal ends of the two screws  21   a  and  21   b  that project out of the extrusion cylinder  20 . A shaft end of the screw  21   b  is connected to a motor  29  through the intermediary of a decelerator  28 .  \\n      The driving speed of the screw extruder  3  is arbitrarily adjustable by the motor  29  or the decelerator  28 .  \\n      In the screw extruder  3  having the construction above, when the screw  21   b  is rotatively driven through the decelerator  28  by the motor  29 , the screw  21   a  is rotatively driven through the intermediary of the conical gears  27   a  and  27   b.  This causes a rubber lump supplied into the hopper  4  to be fed between the upper and lower rolls  1  and  2  through the collet  22  at the distal end of the extrusion cylinder  20 .  \\n      The frames  6   a  and  6   b  are movably supported, on the base  5 , in a horizontal direction orthogonal to the axes of the rolls  1  and  2  through the intermediary of a plurality of rolling wheels  30 , so that they can be moved by a roll moving device  31 . This arrangement allows the pair of rolls  1  and  2  to be moved in relation to the screw extruder  3 . Preferably, the distance between the distal end of the collet  22  and the rolls  1  and  2  is properly set to provide a space for forming an appropriate rubber reservoir therebetween, which will be discussed hereinafter.  \\n      A scraper  33 , which is parallel to the upper roll  1  and has its distal end in contact with the upper roll  1 , is provided at an upper level of the upper roll  1  that is adjacent to the screw extruder  3 . The scraper  33  peels a rubber sheet off of the upper roll  1 . As a carrying means for guiding the peeled rubber sheet into the hopper  4 , a belt conveyor  34  is provided, the belt conveyor  34  extending from below the scraper  33  to the upper edge of the hopper  4 . If, however, the scraper  33  itself has a function for guiding the peeled rubber sheet to the hopper  4 , then the scraper can be used also as the carrying means. This obviates the need for providing the belt conveyor  34 .  \\n      In place of or in addition to the scraper or the like, a belt conveyor  35  may be suspended as the carrying means for carrying rubber sheets, which have been rolled and pushed out from the upper and lower rolls  1  and  2 , back into the hopper  4 . As indicated by the chained line in the drawing, the belt conveyor  35  extends from the rubber sheet outlet side at above the upper roll  1  to the hopper  4  via above the screw extruder  3 .  \\n      In the upper roll  1 , at the side opposite from the screw extruder  3 , a retaining seat  37  of a cutter  38  is provided such that it is slidably moved in parallel to the roll axes by a slide driving mechanism. The cutter  38  is arranged such that it is projected from and retracted into the retaining seat  37  by a pneumatic cylinder, which is not shown. Upon completion of kneading, a rubber sheet coming out from between the upper and lower rolls adheres to the upper roll  1  and transferred toward the screw extruder  3 . The rubber sheet is cut by the cutter  38  in the direction orthogonal to the direction in which the rubber sheet runs, thus peeling the rubber sheet from the upper roll  1 . Preferably, the upper and lower rolls are synchronously rotated when cutting the rubber sheet by the cutter  38 .  \\n      As a carrying mechanism for carrying the rubber sheet, which has been peeled off of the upper roll  1 , out of the system, a belt conveyor  39  for taking out is provided under the lower roll  2 . The rubber sheet coming off of the upper roll is transferred onto the belt conveyor  39 , permitting the rubber sheet to be easily carried out of the system.  \\n      In the rubber kneading machine having the construction described above, a rubber lump fed into the hopper  4  of the screw extruder  3  is supplied between the upper and lower rolls  1  and  2 , rolled between the rolls, and pushed out in the form of a rubber sheet to the side of the rolls opposite from the screw extruder  3 . The rubber sheet is guided to the hopper  4  of the screw extruder  3  by the carrying means constituting the rubber circulating mechanism, namely, the scraper  33  and the belt conveyor  34 , or the belt conveyor  35  or the like above the upper roll  1 , and supplied back to the pair of rolls  1  and  2  by the screw extruder  3 . The circulation of such rubber makes it possible to secure stable quality of kneaded rubber.  \\n      In the above rubber kneading machine, the number of revolutions of the upper and lower rolls  1  and  2  can be independently set at desired values. Hence, the number of revolutions of the upper and lower rolls  1  and  2  can be properly selected to apply sufficient shearing to the rubber passing between the upper and lower rolls  1  and  2  by the difference in the number of revolutions between the rolls. This arrangement makes it possible to enhance the kneading effect and to set conditions or the like advantageous for winding rubber sheets around the upper roll  1  to guide them to the hopper  4 .  \\n      Depending on the type of rubber, rubber sheets wind onto the upper roll  1  when the upper roll  1  is set to run faster than the lower roll  2 . If a rubber includes a natural rubber, then a sheet of the rubber winds around upper roll  1  by setting the upper roll  1  to be slower than the lower roll  2  and the temperature thereof slightly higher than that of the lower roll.  \\n      Upon completion of kneading, the rubber sheet on the upper roll  1  is cut in parallel to the roll axis by the cutter  38 , and at the same time, the upper and lower rolls are synchronously rotated to fall the rubber sheet onto the takeout belt conveyor  39  disposed under the lower roll  2  so as to carry it out of the system, as described above.  \\n      With the rubber kneading machine having the aforesaid mechanism, an operator has only to do a simple, safe operation, such as merely monitoring the machine or placing the leading edge of a rubber sheet coming out of the pair of upper and lower rolls  1  and  2  onto the belt conveyor  35  or the belt conveyor  39 , in order to apply mechanical kneading action to rubber. Thus, the operator hardly touches rubber.  \\n      Especially because the operating side where an operator is likely to touch rubber during the operation is the side where a rubber sheet comes out from the pair of rolls, there is no danger of the operator fingers or hands being caught between the rolls, making the mechanism intrinsically safe.  \\n       FIG. 3  through  FIG. 11  illustrate a second embodiment of the rubber kneading machine according to the present invention. The rubber kneading machine has the same basic construction as that of the first embodiment. As shown in  FIG. 5  and  FIG. 6  in detail, in the second embodiment, a screw extruder  53  for supplying a rubber lump in a hopper  54  to rolls  51  and  52  is constructed such that an extrusion cylinder  70  accommodating screws  71   a  and  71   b,  and a screw extruder main body  53 A that includes the screws  71   a  and  71   b  and a driving mechanism therefor can be separated and detachably fastened by clamps, which will be discussed hereinafter. Furthermore, a pair of left and right frames  56   a  and  56   b  integrated to support the upper and lower rolls  51  and  52  through the intermediary of bearings  57   a,    57   b  and  58   a,    58   b,  and a collet  72  at the distal end of the extrusion cylinder  70  are constructed to be detachable. The frames  56   a,    56   b  and the extrusion cylinder  70  can be driven toward or away from each other, and the extrusion cylinder  70  and the screw extruder main body  53 A can be driven toward or away from each other by a hydraulic cylinder  73  constituting a driving mechanism, which will be discussed hereinafter.  \\n      Both bearings  58   a  and  58   b  of the lower roll  52  are fixedly supported by the frames  56   a  and  56   b,  while the bearings  57   a  and  57   b  receiving both shaft ends of the upper roll  51  are retained by the frames  56   a  and  56   b  such that they are free to move up and down. This constitutes an interval adjusting mechanism for arbitrarily adjusting the interval between the pair of rolls  51  and  52  by moving the upper roll  51  up or down by a driving device  61  provided on the frames.  \\n      To be more specific, in the rubber kneading machine, the screw extruder main body  53 A and the hydraulic cylinder  73  constituting the driving mechanism are fixed on a base  55 , and the frames  56   a  and  56   b  supporting the upper and lower rolls  51  and  52  are fixed on a carriage  74  connected to the hydraulic cylinder  73 . The carriage  74  is supported, through the intermediary of a plurality of rolling wheels  80 , on a rail  55   a  laid on the base  55  such that it is free to travel in a horizontal direction orthogonal to the axes of the rolls  51  and  52 . The extrusion cylinder  70  is supported such that it is free to travel on a rail  74   a  laid on the carriage  74  in a direction in which the frames  56   a  and  56   b  travel.  \\n      Furthermore, two pairs of clamps  81 A,  81 B ( FIG. 7 ) and  82 A,  82 B ( FIG. 3 ,  FIG. 8  and  FIG. 9 ) are provided on the surfaces of the frames  56   a,    56   b  and the screw extruder main body  53 A, which face the extrusion cylinder  70 , to detachably fasten the extrusion cylinder  70  to the frames  56   a,    56   b  and the screw extruder main body  53 A, respectively. When the clamps  81 A,  81 B or the clamps  82 A,  82 B are removed, the frames  56   a,    56   b  and the screw extruder main body  53 A can be moved toward or away from each other by driving the hydraulic cylinder  73 . The rail  55   a  on the base  55  and the rail  74   a  on the carriage  74  are extended, the clamps  81 A and  81 B are released, the hydraulic cylinder is advanced, the clamps  82 A and  82 B are released at a position where a stop sensor (not shown) is actuated, and the hydraulic cylinder is further traveled forward to a forward limit. This allows the extrusion cylinder  70  to be separated from the frames  56   a,    56   b  and the screw extruder main body  53 A at the same time.  \\n      The aforesaid driving mechanism is not limited to the one constructed of the hydraulic cylinder  73  described above. Alternatively, a direct acting machine constructed of a mechanical direct power transmitting means, such as a screw rack pinion or the like, may be used.  \\n      The clamps  81 A,  81 B provided on the frames  56   a,    56   b  include engaging portions  83   a,    83   b  that engage and fasten a flange  59  provided on the frames  56   a,    56   b  and a flange  75  provided on a collet  72  at the distal end of the extrusion cylinder  70  from both sides, and hydraulic cylinders  84   a,    84   b  that drive the engaging portions, as clearly shown in  FIG. 7 .  \\n      The engaging portions  83   a,    83   b  are formed to be substantially U-shaped as observed from above, and their inner opposing surfaces are tapered toward back. With the flange  59  adjacent to the frames  56   a  and  56   b  and the flange  75  adjacent to the distal end of the extrusion cylinder  70  abutted against each other, the hydraulic cylinders  84   a  and  84   b  are driven to cause the engaging portions to engage the outer tapered surfaces of the flanges  59  and  75  from both sides thereby to fasten the extrusion cylinder  70  to the frames  56   a  and  56   b.    \\n      The constructions of the clamps  82 A and  82 B will now be explained.  \\n      In the following explanation, the clamps  82 A and  82 B appear to be surface-symmetrical through a plane going straight to the axis of the roll  51  at the center thereof. Hence, only the clamp  82 A will be explained, and the explanation of the clamp  82 B will be omitted, the auxiliary reference characteristics A being replaced by B and a being replaced by b.  \\n      The clamp  82 A provided on the screw extruder main body  53 A is constructed such that an engaging member  85   a  that engages a flange  89  at the proximal end of the extrusion cylinder  70  to fasten it is rotatively supported by a flange  86  of the screw extruder main body  53 A with pins  87 , and the engaging member  85   a  is displaced between a fastening position (the position indicated by the solid line in  FIG. 8 ) and a releasing position (the position indicated by the chain line in  FIG. 8 ) by a hydraulic cylinder  90   a  swingably installed to the screw extruder main body  53 A with a pin  95 , as clearly shown in  FIG. 8  and  FIG. 9 .  \\n      Specifically, the engaging member  85   a  in the clamp  82 A is formed to be substantially U-shaped, as observed sideways, having an engaging member main body  91   a  and arms  92   a  and  93   a  extending in parallel from both ends thereof (refer to  FIG. 9 ). The distal ends of the upper and lower arms  92   a  and  93   a  are rotatively supported by the flange  86  of the screw extruder main body  53 A by the pins  87 . The upper arm  92   a  in the engaging member  85   a  has its distal end extended outward to be formed substantially like a hook, and a rod  88   a  of the hydraulic cylinder  90   a  is rotatively connected to the distal end thereof by a pin  94 . With the flange  89  adjacent to the extrusion cylinder  70  and the flange  86  of the screw extruder main body  53 A abutted each other, the hydraulic cylinder  90   a  is driven to swing the engaging member  85   a  thereby to engage the main body  91   a  of the engaging member  85   a  at a position opposing the flange  89  adjacent to the extrusion cylinder  70 . Thus, the extrusion cylinder  70  can be fastened to the screw extruder main body  53 A.  \\n      In the aforesaid rubber kneading machine, if the extrusion cylinder  70  is fixed to the frames  56   a  and  56   b  of the rolls  51  and  52  by the clamps  81 A and  81 B, the clamps  82 A and  82 B between the extrusion cylinder  70  and the screw extruder main body  53 A are removed, and the frames  56   a  and  56   b  are driven away from the screw extruder main body  53 A by the hydraulic cylinder  73 , then the extrusion cylinder  70  will be separated from the screw extruder main body  53 A while it remains connected with the frames  56   a  and  56   b,  and the frames  56   a  and  56   b  travel on the rail  55   a  on the base  55 , and the extrusion cylinder  70  travels, being rested on the rail  74   a  on the carriage  74 . Thus, the screws  71   a  and  71   b  are drawn out of the extrusion cylinder  70 . When the screws  71   a  and  71   b  are pulled out, the entire screws can be cleaned. Similarly, the interior of the extrusion cylinder  70  can be cleaned and inspected.  \\n      The extrusion cylinder  70  is movably supported by the rail  74   a  on the carriage  74 , so that lateral or vertical junction errors will not be produced when the extrusion cylinder  70  is fixed back onto the screw extruder main body  53 A.  \\n      Meanwhile, if the clamps  81 A and  81 B between the extrusion cylinder  70  and the frames  56   a  and  56   b  are removed, and the hydraulic cylinder  73  is driven to drive the carriage  74 , while the extrusion cylinder  70  and the screw extruder main body  53 A are fixed by the clamps  82 A and  82 B, then the frames  56   a  and  56   b  travel on the rail  55   a  of the base  55  away from the screw extruder  53 . At this time, the extrusion cylinder  70  slides on the rail  74   a  on the carriage  74 ; however, it does not actually move since it is fastened to the screw extruder main body  53 A by the clamps  82 A and  82 B. As a result, a gap is produced between the frames  56   a,    56   b  and the extrusion cylinder  70 . This makes it possible to sufficiently clean the rolls  51  and  52  and the collet  72  of the extrusion cylinder  70  that comes in contact with the rolls.  \\n      In the rubber kneading machine having the aforesaid construction, the frames  56   a,    56   b  supporting the upper and lower rolls  51 ,  52 , and the distal end of the extrusion cylinder  70  are detachably installed by fastening the clamps  81 A and  81 B, and the extrusion cylinder  70  accommodating the screws  71   a  and  71   b  in the screw extruder  53  is detachably installed to the screw extruder main body  53 A by the clamps  82 A and  82 B. Furthermore, the frames  56   a,    56   b  and the extrusion cylinder  70 , and the extrusion cylinder  70  and the screw extruder main body  53 A can be moved toward or away from each other by driving the hydraulic cylinder  73  constituting the driving mechanism for moving the extrusion cylinder  70  and the screw extruder main body  53 A. Therefore, the rolls  51 ,  52  and the collet  72  at the distal end of the extrusion cylinder  70  can be cleaned easily and securely by moving the frames  56   a,    56   b,  which support the rolls  51 ,  52 , and the extrusion cylinder  70  away from each other when, for example, the color or composition of a rubber dough is changed, while maintaining high safety for operators by the high level of closure design. Moreover, the extrusion cylinder  70  and the screw extruder main body  53 A can be moved apart from each other to release the screws  71   a  and  71   b,  thus allowing the interior of the extrusion cylinder  70  and the screws  71   a  and  71   b  to be cleaned easily and securely.  \\n      In addition, as can be understood from  FIG. 10  and  FIG. 11 , a rubber fall preventing plate  96 , which is in contact with the lower roll  52  and whose entire surface is horizontal, is provided between the upper and lower rolls  51 ,  52  and the distal end of the collet  72  of the screw extruder  53 , and upright walls  97 ,  97  are provided such that they are in contact with the rubber fall preventing plate  96 . The interval between the walls can be freely set by interval adjustment screw rods  97   a  provided on right and left outer sides of the rubber fall preventing plate  96 . A space  98  formed by the components serves as a rubber reservoir. A detector  99  for detecting the amount of accumulated rubber in the rubber reservoir is provided at an upper level of the open rubber reservoir. The detector  99  has a lifting plate  99   a  rotatively retained above the rubber reservoir by a hinge  99   b.  The rotational angle of the lifting plate  99   a  is detected by a sensor  100  in the hinge  99   b  so as to detect the amount of accumulated rubber. The number of revolutions of the screws  71   a  and  71   b  are adjusted on the basis of the amount of the rubber accumulated in the space  98  detected by the sensor  100  so as to allow banking of the rubber in the space  98 . For the sensor  100 , a potentiometer, an encoder, or a proximity switch or the lik may be used.  \\n      The rest of the construction and operation of the second embodiment is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment. Hence, like reference numerals will be assigned to like or equivalent parts and explanation thereof will be omitted.  \\n       FIG. 12  shows another embodiment (third embodiment) related to the rubber reservoir. In this third embodiment, a pair of right and left walls  101 ,  101  is fixedly and vertically installed on a horizontal rubber fall preventing plate  96  in contact with a lower roll  52  at the roll side of a flange  59  provided adjacently to roll frames. A rotative plate  102  for setting the sectional area of a rubber compression passage between the walls  101  and  101  is provided in contact with the walls  101  and  101  such that its position can be vertically adjusted. A detector  103  for detecting the amount of rubber accumulated is provided in a rubber reservoir formed in the vicinity of the exit of the rotative plate  102 .  \\n      To explain more specifically, the rotative plate  102  is rotatively supported by a hinge  102   a.  The rotative plate  102  is fixed by inserting a locking pin  101   b  in one of many setting holes  101   a  provided in the walls  101  and  101  on both sides so as to perform adjustment for a rubber sheet G to have an optimum ejection thickness with respect to the walls  101  and  101 . At a distal end in the vicinity of the exit of the rotative plate  102 , a lifting plate  103   a  abutted against the upper surface of the discharged rubber sheet G is supported by a hinge  103   b  such that it may move up or down, and the vertical movement of the lifting plate  103   a  is detected by a sensor  104  of a potentiometer, an encoder, or a proximity switch or the like. The amount of accumulated rubber can be detected by detecting an angle or the like by the sensor  104 , and base on an output thereof, the numbers of revolutions of the screws  71   a  and  71   b  are adjusted so as to obtain banking of rubber in the rubber reservoir.  \\n      A rubber lump is formed into a sheet of a predetermined thickness by the rotative plate  102  and discharged to the rubber reservoir. Thus, when the rubber sheet passes the rubber fall preventing plate  96  and is fed to the position where the rolls  51  and  52  mesh each other, it swirls when the upper and lower rolls  51  and  52  rotate at different speeds. This makes it easy to roll the rubber sheet out into the space between the walls  97  and  97 , and also to facilitate mixing and kneading.  \\n      The rest of the construction and operation of the third embodiment are substantially the same as those of the second embodiment.  \\n     EXAMPLE  \\n      A rubber lump mixed and kneaded under a predetermined condition by a closed kneading machine (pressure kneader) was fed into the hopper  4  of the rubber kneading machine according to the first embodiment described above, and processed under the same conditions as those of a conventional roll machine. Depending on the type of rubber, the upper roll was set to be faster than the lower roll, so that the rubber wound on the upper roll, and was easily transferred by the scraper onto the belt conveyor, and then circulated to the hopper  4 . The temperature of the rubber to be kneaded was set to 100\\u00b0 C., which is the same as that in the conventional roll kneading machine. The rubber was rolled into a sheet and taken out, and then sent out to a cooling apparatus. In about one minute after circulation was started, a powdered vulcanizing agent was added to the rubber in the hopper by hand, and the rubber was circulated for two minutes at 20 rpm, the rotational ratio of the upper and lower rolls being set at 1.15:1.0. The dispersion of the vulcanizing agent in the rubber sheet take out was checked by taking a total of 16 samples, one per 1 meter of a sheet. Results of the measurement of hardness after vulcanization indicated that variations in hardness were within +1\\u00b0 (JIS hardness), making it possible to determine that the dispersion effect was satisfactory.  \\n      Unlike the rubber kneading operation using a conventional roll type, an operator mostly monitored the operation without touching the rubber during the kneading operation, and the kneading of rubber to be kneaded was finished about 15% sooner than by the conventional roll type. When the upper and lower rolls independently driven were set at different speeds, the kneading time shortened, and when they were set at the same speed, a smooth rubber sheet could be taken out. A finished sheet in this case is defined as a sheet having the same smoothness as the sheet kneaded by the conventional roll machine and has the same level of Mooney viscosity measured using a Mooney viscosity tester. In this case, it was 70\\u00b13@ ML1+4 100\\u00b0 C.  \\n      In the aforesaid operation of the rubber kneading machine, the time from the moment rubber starts to be transferred from the scraper of the upper roll into the hopper of the screw extruder to the moment the rubber is cut off from the upper roll and taken out was set to 1 minute for preliminary kneading and 2 minutes after adding the vulcanizing agent, the time being set by a timer. During this time, rolls having a diameter of 400 mm were run at 20 rpm, and 70 kg (60 liters) of rubber measuring 10 mm thick and 500 mm wide was subjected to four cycle of kneading. Satisfactory kneading operation was observed.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004105216-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"An electrode sheet for an electric double-layer capacitor is provided.

And the casing  102  is filled with an ion conductive electrolytic solution. The electric double-layer capacitor  101  employs electric charges (shown by + and \\u2212 in FIG. 1) as dielectrics in a normal capacitor, which are generated at an interface between the solid carbon electrodes  104  and the liquid electrolytic solution, and spaced at a distance of molecule.  \\n       [0006] Electrolytic solutions used for electric double-layer capacitors are roughly categorized into an aqueous electrolytic solution made of a dilute sulfuric acid added with an electrolyte and an organic electrolytic solution made of an organic solvent added with an electrolyte. An appropriate type of electrolytic solution is selectably applied to an electric double-layer capacitor taking into account its usage. An electric double-layer capacitor using an aqueous electrolytic solution is advantageous in terms of lower internal resistance and higher power density. On the other hand, an organic electrolytic solution, which allows a higher withstand voltage per cell, is advantageous in terms of energy density. It also allows selection of inexpensive and light metals such as an aluminum alloy for a casing.  \\n       [0007] A method for manufacturing an electrode sheet is generally used, which has a process of mixing an electrochemically active material such as activated carbon, an electrically conductive filler such as carbon black and a binder such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Japanese Patent Publication 07-105316 (Japanese Published Patent Application 63-107011) reports the related art.  \\n       [0008] Japanese Patent Publication 07-105316 does not fully explain the interaction between an electrode sheet and an electric double-layer capacitor, although the document introduces the parameters such as the porosity and Gurley number of electrode sheet. This has necessitated establishment of a criterion, which is applicable to manufacturing of an electrode sheet. Especially, the criterion for electrode sheet, which is used for an electric double-layer capacitor that has low electrical resistance and stable performance, has been in great demand.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0009] In the circumstances, the present invention provides an electrode sheet and its manufacturing method, which enable manufacturing of this type of electric double-layer capacitor. The present invention also provides a polarizable electrode including the electrode sheet and the electric double-layer capacitor using the polarizable electrode.  \\n       [0010] Applicants have found that a contact angle between an electrode sheet and a droplet of electrolytic solution can be controlled so that an electric double-layer capacitor can have low electrical resistance and stable performance. The applicants have also discovered that the desirable contact angle can be obtained by manufacturing the granules for electrode sheet under preferably selected conditions of process associated with kneading.  \\n       [0011] An aspect of the present invention provides an electrode sheet for an electric double-layer capacitor, and the electrode sheet is molded from granules which are produced from ingredients including an electrochemically active material, an electrically conductive filler and a binder. In this aspect, a contact angle is equal to or less than 100 degrees when the contact angle is defined as (180-ALPHA) degrees, where ALPHA represents an apex angle of a droplet of an electrolytic solution for the electric double-layer capacitor, and when the droplet lies on the electrode sheet.  \\n       [0012] In this way, it is possible to obtain the electrode sheet described above, which can be used for the electric double-layer capacitor having stable performance and low electrical resistance due to improvement in wetness.  \\n       [0013] Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for manufacturing an electrode sheet for an electric double-layer capacitor. The electrode sheet is molded from granules which are produced from ingredients including an electrochemically active material, an electrically conductive filler and a binder. The method includes the steps of (a) kneading the ingredients so that the binder is subjected to fibrillation, and molding a lump out of the ingredients after the fibrillation, (b) crushing the lump into granules for the electrode sheet of the electric double-layer capacitor and (c) forming the granules into the electrode sheet. In this aspect, one of a period of time and strength of kneading at the step (a) is adjusted so that a contact angle can be equal to or less than 100 degrees when the contact angle is defined as (180-ALPHA) degrees, where ALPHA represents an apex angle of a droplet of an electrolytic solution for the electric double-layer capacitor, and when the droplet lies on the electrode sheet.  \\n       [0014] The electrode sheet described above allows repetitive manufacturing of an electric double-layer capacitor that has lower electric resistance and stable performance.  \\n       [0015] In this connection, the period of time and the strength correlated with the contact angle less than (180-ALPHA) degrees have been demonstrated by an experiment or a simulation based on data obtained by the experiment. The conditions applied to the experiment, which include ingredients, a mixing ratio, a thickness of electrode sheet and a method of manufacturing, are fixed for the experiment and simulation.  \\n       [0016] It is preferable to select classified granules having a particle diameter of 47-840 micron meters for manufacturing the electrode sheet according to the present invention.  \\n       [0017] The granules selected this way prevent fine particles of carbon and electrically conductive filler from separating or desorbing from the electrode sheet, so that they may not float in an electrolytic solution or exist between separators. It will enable manufacturing of the electric double-layer capacitor, which has high efficiency in terms of voltage maintenance.  \\n       [0018] Still another aspect of the present invention provides a polarizable electrode for an electric double-layer capacitor, including an electrode sheet and a collector foil. The electrode sheet is molded from granules which are produced from ingredients, including an electrochemically active material, an electrically conductive filler and a binder. The collector foil is bonded with the electrode sheet directly or via a layer of an adhesive so as to form the polarizable electrode.

Electric Double-layer Capacitor  \\n     [0035] An electrode sheet and an electric double-layer capacitor which uses polarizable electrodes according to the present invention are described, referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B and FIGS. 3A and 3B.  \\n     [0036] An electric double-layer capacitor  1  shown in FIG. 2A mainly includes a cylindrical casing  2 , a rolled electrode  3  which is made of polarizable electrodes  9 ,  10  and separators SP, and an electrolytic solution filled in the casing  2 .  \\n     [0037] The casing  2  is, for example, made of an aluminum alloy taking into account easy processing and light weight. The casing  2  includes a cylindrical main body  4  with a base and a terminal plate  5  to close its opening, on which positive and negative terminals  6  and  7  are provided, respectively. The terminals  6  and  7  may be located on the opposite sides of the casing  2  instead.  \\n     [0038] As shown in FIG. 2A, the rolled electrode  3  has the polarizable electrode  9  as a positive electrode and the polarizable electrode  10  as a negative electrode.  \\n     [0039] The polarizable electrode  9  includes a collector foil  11  made of aluminum foil, on each surface of which an electrode sheet E is bonded with an electrically conductive adhesive to serve as a positive film electrode.  \\n     [0040] The polarizable electrode  10  includes a collector foil  14 , on each surface of which an electrode sheet E is bonded with an electrically conductive adhesive to serve as a negative film electrode.  \\n     [0041] The positive and negative polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  are electrically separated by separators SP. The rolled electrode  3  is formed in such a manner that the positive and negative polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  are laminated interposing a separator SP.  \\n     [0042] In this connection, it may be possible to select a separator generally used in the related technical fields, for example paper mixed with resin such as porous olefinic resin (polyethylene or polypropylene) or paper mixed with fiber such as cellulose or polyester.  \\n     [0043] An electrolyte applied to the electric double-layer capacitor  1  can also be selected from electrolytes which have been used conventionally. Though it is not limited to those, following electrolytes can be named, for example: perchloric acid, hexafluoro phosphoric acid, tetrafluoro boric acid, tetraalkyl ammonium salt or amine salt of trifluoro alkyl sulfonic acid and tetraalkyl ammonium salt or amine salt of tetrafluoro alkyl sulfonic acid.  \\n     [0044] These electrolytes are solved into a polarizing solvent such as propylene carbonate, gamma butyl lactone, acetonitrile, dimethylhormamide, 1, 2-dimethoxy ethane, Sulfolan and nitro ethane, forming an electrolytic solution.  \\n     [0045] The polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  shown in FIG. 2B, which are applied to an electric double-layer capacitor of coin type for example, are used without rolling different from those in the rolled electrode  3  as shown in FIG. 2A. The application of polarizable electrodes is flexible and this type of application of polarizable electrodes without rolling is also included in the scope of the present invention.  \\n     [0046] Description would be omitted for the items of an electric double-layer capacitor shown in FIG. 2B, which are the same as those shown in FIG. 2A, bearing the same symbols.  \\n     [0047] An electric double-layer capacitor  30  shown in FIG. 2B has a lamination of polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  and a separator SP, which is impregnated with an electrolytic solution.  \\n     [0048] The polarizable electrode  9  and  10  are made of collector foils  11  and  14 , both sides of which are bonded with electrode sheets E using an electrically conductive adhesive (refer to FIGS. 3A and 3B).  \\n     [0049] The positive polarizable electrode  9  and the negative polarizable electrode  10 , which interpose the separator SP impregnated with the electrolytic solution, are housed in the housing made of two parts  20  and  21  to form the electric double-layer capacitor  30  of coin-type. In this connection, the upper casing  20  contacting the positive polarizable electrode  9  serves as a positive electrode, on the other hand the lower housing  21  as a negative electrode. The present invention can also be applied to this type of electric double-layer capacitor.  \\n     [0050] The polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  are described referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B. The polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  are made of collector foils  11  and  14  respectively, one or both surfaces of which are bonded with the electrode sheets E. It may be preferable to give surface treatment such as etching for the collector foils  11  and  14  to improve adhesion with the electrode sheets E. An electrode sheet E is molded out of ingredients including an electrochemically active material, an electrically conductive filler and a binder, and formed into a sheet-like shape by rolling.  \\n     [0051] The electrochemically active material for the electrode sheet E according to the present invention can be selected arbitrarily from known materials used for electric double-layer capacitors, such as activated carbon or carbon fiber. In order to obtain large electrostatic capacity, it may be possible to select activated carbon or activated carbon fiber having a large specific surface, preferably activated carbon produced from graphitized carbon with carbonization and subsequent alkali activation, mesophase pitch, for example.  \\n     [0052] There is no limitation for the average particle diameter of the electrochemically active material, and those having 1-50 micron meters, preferably 6 micron meters can be used. The mass ratio of electrochemically active material relative to the electrode sheet E according to the present invention falls in a known range, namely 50-97 mass percent. If an amount of electrochemically active material is short, it is not possible to realize desired electrostatic capacity. On the other hand, if it is excessive, electrical conductivity tends to deteriorate.  \\n     [0053] Electrically conductive fine powder used in the related technical field such as carbon black can be used for the electrically conductive filler, which is used for making an electrode conductive. A conventionally known value may be applied to the amount of filler according to the present invention, which is typically 1-30 mass percent. If the amount of filler is short, the electric conductivity of the electrode drops. On the other hand, if it is excessive, electrostatic capacity tends to decrease.  \\n     [0054] Various binders found in the related technical field can be used for the present invention. Though it is not limited, the following fluororesins can be named, for example: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, chlorotrifluoroethylene polymer, fluorovinylidene polymer and tetrafluoroethylene-fluoroalkylvinylether copolymer. It is preferable to select PTFE in the present invention taking into account heat durability and chemical resistance.  \\n     [0055] An amount of binder, which is a part of granules of an electrode sheet, is an important parameter for determining a contact angle. As described later, the contact angle increases substantially proportional to the amount of binder. It is preferable to select an amount of 2-20 mass percent in the present invention. If the amount of binder is short, the binder can not work efficiently. On the other hand, if it is excessive, the electrostatic capacity of an electrode decreases. Also the contact angle tends to increase too much.  \\n     [0056] The electrode sheet E has surface characteristics, which allow a desirable range of contact angle between a droplet of electrolytic solution and the surface of electrode sheet E.  \\n     [0057] The contact angle is described in detail referring to FIGS.  4 A- 4 C. As shown in FIG. 4A, the contact angle is defined as (180-ALPHA) degrees where ALPHA is an apex angle of the droplet when it is on the electrode sheet E.  \\n     [0058] The preferable contact angle of the present invention is less than or equal to 100 degrees, more preferably between 30 and 90 degrees. As shown in FIG. 4B, the wetness of an electrolytic solution to the electrode sheet E increases as the contact angle decreases, so that the electric resistance falls and the efficiency in terms of voltage maintenance rises accordingly. On the other hand as shown in FIG. 4C, when the contact angle grows exceeding the preferable range of the present invention, the wetness decreases and thereby the electric resistance increases.  \\n     [0059] Repeated experiments of the present invention have demonstrated that when the contact angle is less than or equal to 100 degrees, the electrode sheet E can work efficiently, so that the polarizable electrodes  9 ,  10  and the electric double layer capacitor  1  can also work well.  \\n     [0060] Once the contact angle exceeds 100 degrees, the electric resistance starts increasing remarkably. It results in a possible decrease in the output of the electric double-layer capacitor  1 . On the other hand, the electrostatic capacity tends to fall as the contact angle decreases. The embodiment of the present invention has selected a preferable range of contact angle 30-90 degrees, which gives appropriate conditions for the electric double-layer capacitor  1  in terms of a balance between the electrostatic capacity and electric resistance that has an effect on the output of capacitor.  \\n     [0061] It is preferable to select a range of 47-840 micron meters for the diameter of granule used for the electrode sheet E.  \\n     [0062] If the granules for electrode sheet include those with a particle diameter less than 47 micron meters, these too fine granules remain on the surface of the electrode sheet E. They tend to peel off the surface of electrode sheet E during storage and subsequent processes as well as assembly of the electric double-layer capacitor  1 . Especially, after the assembly of electric double-layer capacitor  1 , these too fine granules peeled off the surface come into separators SP or float in an electrolytic solution, and thereby the efficiency for voltage maintenance may possibly drop.  \\n     [0063] In this connection, \\u201ca particle diameter\\u201d is related to an aperture diameter of sieve.  \\n     [0064] An electric double-layer capacitor  1  is assembled in the following manner, which has not only low electrical resistance but also high efficiency for voltage maintenance. First, granules with a predetermined range of diameter are formed into electrode sheets E, which are subsequently bonded with collector foils  11  and  14  to form polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  as shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. The polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  are then installed into a casing  2  to complete the electric double-layer capacitor  1 .  \\n     [0065] b. Manufacturing Method  \\n     [0066] A method for manufacturing the electrode sheets E and the polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  for the electric double-layer capacitor  1  is described with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6. FIG. 5 is a flow diagram showing a process for manufacturing an electrode sheet and polarizable electrode. FIG. 6 is a graph showing the relationship between a time period of kneading and a contact angle. The method is described as an example and other methods can be applied to the manufacturing process.  \\n     [0067] Process for Mixing Ingredients At a step S 1 , an electrochemically active material, an electrically conductive filler, a binder and additives as required are collected into a mixer and mixed uniformly, for example at several thousands rpm for about 20 minutes.  \\n     [0068] Mixing and Kneading Process  \\n     [0069] At a step S 2 , the ingredients mixed at the step S 1  are kneaded by a machine for kneading, preferably two-axis machine, under heated conditions (for example 60-90 degrees centigrade), at a slow rotational speed (for example 10-40 rpm) and under reduced pressure conditions (for example 0.2-0.5 MPa), for a determined period of time.  \\n     [0070] As shown in FIG. 6, the contact angle increases according to the time period of kneading and reaches a peak, decreasing thereafter. Assuming that a desired range of contact angle is X, there are two time periods X 1  and X 2 , during which the desired range can be achieved by conducting a kneading process. These two appear before and after the contact angle reaching the peak, respectively.  \\n     [0071] It is preferable to select the earlier one taking into account the deterioration of granules subjected to longer process and saving of process time.  \\n     [0072] It is noted that graphs shown in FIG. 6 is for the ingredients of exemplary composition, which were processed under predetermined conditions such as rotational speed and temperature. It is possible to determine a contact angle depending on the composition of ingredients and the conditions for process.  \\n     [0073] A graph similar to FIG. 6 can be obtained, by selecting rotational speed for horizontal axis and setting a constant value for the time period.  \\n     [0074] In this way, an electrode sheet E according to the present invention can be obtained, which includes granules having a desirable contact angle, by determining a kneading time period or a rotational speed.  \\n     [0075] By kneading ingredients under predetermined conditions, it is possible to produce relatively large granules used for the electrode sheet E, which are made of an electrochemically active material and an electrically conductive filler that are bound together by a softened binder.  \\n     [0076] Crushing Process  \\n     [0077] At a step S 3 , the relatively large particles of granules produced at the step S 2  are crushed into an appropriate size of particles suitable for the electrode sheet E of electric double-layer capacitor  1 .  \\n     [0078] Classification Process  \\n     [0079] The granules crushed at the step S 3  include those unsuitable for the electrode sheet E, too fine or large granules. At a step S 4 , these granules are classified and eliminated. For example, granules having a particle diameter greater than 840 micron meters are eliminated using a sieve of aperture 840 micron meters. It is preferable to return the granules larger than 840 micron meters to the step S 3  so that they can be subjected to another round of crushing. Subsequently, too fine granules are eliminated with another sieve of aperture 47 micron meters and thereby the granules satisfying the required range of particle diameter can be selected. It may be possible to return the eliminated granules to the step S 2  so that they can be recycled.  \\n     [0080] The sequence of classification can be selectively determined. For example, finer granules are classified before larger ones, which is the opposite sequence of process compared to that described above.  \\n     [0081] Preliminary Forming Process  \\n     [0082] The granules subjected to the steps S 1 -S 4  undergo preliminary forming at a step S 6 , being molded into a pre-electrode sheet.  \\n     [0083] It is possible to conduct forming at the step S 6  by introducing a conventional method, for example a pair of rollers with a predetermined gap through which pass the granules for an electrode sheet E with a solution such as isopropanol.  \\n     [0084] Rolling Process  \\n     [0085] At a step S 7 , the pre-electrode sheet is rolled to a predetermined thickness. It is possible to conduct rolling process at the step S 7  by making the pre-electrode sheet pass a conventional roller. For example, if the thickness of 130-160 micron meters for the electrode sheet E is desired, it is possible to make the thickness smaller gradually using three types of roller of different gaps. The rollers are laid out so that one having a smaller gap is situated downstream. This approach protects against defects such as breaking of the electrode sheet E since it precludes a chance of exerting sudden large load on the electrode sheet E.  \\n     [0086] It is not limited to the rolling process described above, in which the electrode sheet E passes through plural types of roller consecutively. Alternatively, it is possible to make the electrode sheet E pass through the rollers step by step.  \\n     [0087] The electrode sheet E described above, which is manufactured using granules that have the predetermined range of particle diameter without undesirably fine or large particle selected by a sieve, can be free from having fine particles on its surface.  \\n     [0088] Bonding Process  \\n     [0089] Next, polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  of the present invention are manufactured at a step S 8  by bonding electrode sheets E with the collector foils  11  and  14 . A bonding process shown in FIG. 5 is used, which has a first roller that applies an adhesive to the collector foils  11  and  14  in a predetermined thickness, and a second roller that conducts bonding by pressure for the collector foils  11  and  14  with the electrode sheets E.  \\n     [0090] In this connection, in a case where the collector foils  11  and  14 , both surfaces of which are bonded with electrode sheets E, it may be possible to conduct the step S 8  for one of the two surfaces at a time.  \\n     [0091] The collector foils  11  and  14  of polarizable electrodes  9  and  10 , either one surface of which is bonded with an electrode sheet E or both surfaces of which are bonded with electrode sheets E, are dried using a conventional method. In this way, the manufacturing of polarizable electrodes  9  and  10  is completed.  \\n     [0092] Although the electrically conductive adhesive has been described above in the explanation for bonding of the electrode sheets E with collector foils  11  and  14 , it may be possible to apply crimp instead of the adhesive.  \\n     [0093] Electrode samples have been manufactured and their characteristics have been studied by measurement. It is understood that the present invention should not be limited to the exemplary cases described below based on the samples.  \\n     [0094] Sample 1  \\n     [0095] Activated carbon having a median diameter of nearly 6 micron meters was used as an electrochemically active material, with which acetylene black as an electrically conductive filler and TEFLON (trade mark) as a binder were mixed. The composition ratio of these three materials, the activated carbon, the acetylene black and the TEFLON, was 82:8:10. This mixture added with isopropyl alcohol underwent a kneading process under pressurization for fibrillation of the TEFLON for 8 minutes, thereby resulting in a kneaded material.  \\n     [0096] The kneaded material was then crushed, becoming crushed powder having an average diameter of 0.5 mm. The crushed material was further added with isopropyl alcohol and was subjected to a calendar process so as to be a sheet-like molding. The molding underwent a rolling process, resulting in an electrode sheet. The electrode sheet was bonded to a collector foil, forming a polarizable electrode. A tape G-5780A made by Notape Co. Ltd. was used for bonding.  \\n     [0097] The polarizable electrode was cut to a desired length and rolled with two sheets of separator having a thickness of 50 micron meters. The rolled electrode was housed in an experimental casing, which was then subjected to a drying process under a vacuum condition at 160 degrees centigrade for 72 hours. An electrolytic solution, propylenecarbonate solution having a concentration of 1.8 mol/L of quaternary ammonium salt, was injected into the casing. In this way, an experimental electric double-layer capacitor was manufactured.  \\n     [0098] The experimental electric double-layer capacitor was then subjected to an impregnation process and an aging process for degassing. And its voltage and electrostatic capacity were measured. The contact angle was measured using a fixed camera which enlarged a droplet of nearly 20 micron litters of an electrolytic solution, which was held on the end of a micro syringe and attached on the surface of electrode sheet. The results are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.  \\n     [0099] Other electrode sheets were manufactured, which had different kneading periods of time such as 2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 minutes, and their contact angle, electrical resistance and electrostatic capacity were measured. Also, other electrode sheets were manufactured with varied composition ratios of TEFLON such as 6, 12 and 16 percent, and the same measurement was conducted. The results are also shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.  \\n     [0100] The results of FIG. 7 show that the contact angle increases according to the kneading time period, and it starts decreasing when the time period exceeds 10 minutes (compare to FIG. 6). It is also known that the electrical resistance decreases as the contact angle decreases. It may be attributable to insufficient kneading that the electrostatic capacity is relatively small in the case of the time period of 2 minutes.  \\n     [0101] Similarly, the results of FIG. 8 show that that the contact angle and electrical resistance increase according to the amount of binder.  \\n     [0102] Samples 2-7  \\n     [0103] Mass ratio among activated carbon, acetylene black and TEFRON as well as kneading time period were varied according to FIG. 9 and the measurement was conducted. The results are shown in FIG. 9, FIGS.  10 A- 10 C and FIGS.  11 A- 11 C. The results of sample 1 are also shown in FIG. 9 along with those of samples 2-7.  \\n     [0104] It is known from FIG. 9, FIGS.  10 A- 10 C and FIGS.  11 A- 11 C that the amount of binder and the contact angle are correlated to each other. The results demonstrate that the larger the contact angle is, the higher the electrical resistance and the electrostatic static capacity are. When the contact angle is about 60 degrees, a balanced condition is achieved where the electrical resistance is compatible with electrostatic capacity.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004112295-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A feeding apparatus for use within a terrarium for feeding insects such as crickets to reptiles and/or other animals in the terrarium.

The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of \\u201cincluding,\\u201d \\u201ccomprising,\\u201d \\u201chaving,\\u201d \\u201ccontaining\\u201d, or \\u201cinvolving,\\u201d and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. In the following description the device is sometimes called \\u201creptile feeder\\u201d or defined as used for feeding that animal, but it should be understood that these terms do not limit the application of the invention to that specific animal.  \\n     [0020] The reptile and amphibian feeder is a feeding device that holds insects, primarily for use within a terrarium  62 . In particular, the feeder is used with a vitamin supplement powder  64 . Shown in FIG. 1, the feeder provides a method for easily incorporating a vitamin supplement powder with a live food source, minimizing excess powder use and mess. The live food source, usually insects, is gently mixed with the supplement powder within the feeder, until the insects are lightly coated with the powder. FIG. 2 shows the feeder in place inside the terrarium  62 , and also shows an insect slowly exiting the device into the terrarium  62  for consumption by the reptiles or other animals in it.  \\n     [0021] In a preferred embodiment, the reptile feeder  10  includes a feeder body  20  and a feeder lid  40  that define a chamber  28  and when aligned, properly register with one another to close the chamber. The shape of the reptile feeder can be of any desirable configuration, such as a rock, mound of earth, tree stump, etc. The preferred embodiment shown is a simulated rock. The rock design adds to the decor of the terrarium and it also maintains the look of the natural surrounding in the terrarium. The feeder  10  is preferably made of polyresin.  \\n     [0022] Shown in FIG. 3, the feeder body  20  includes an insect port  22  and a corresponding insect plug  24 . The port  22  can be located anywhere on the feeder body  20  and provides an exit for the insects from the chamber  28 . In a preferred embodiment, the insects are crickets. The insect plug  24  is inserted into the insect port  22  whenever it is desired to retain the feeder contents in the feeder chamber. The feeder body  20  also has a filling opening  26  that is closed by the feeder lid  40 . The opening  26  is used to introduce insects and vitamin supplement powder into the reptile chamber  28 .  \\n     [0023] When the feeder chamber  28  is filled with the desired amount of insects and supplement powder, the feeder lid  40  is used to close the filling opening  26 . A raised lip  42  located on the feeder lid  40  assists in aligning the lid and body  20  and also prevents the feeder body  20  from sliding off the lid  40 . When the port  22  and openings  26  are closed, the reptile feeder is gently shaken to thoroughly coat the insects with the supplement powder.  \\n     [0024] The reptile feeder  10  full of insects coated with the supplement powder is placed in the terrarium  62 . The plug  24  is then removed, allowing the insects to exit the reptile feeder into the terrarium. The reptile or other animal within the terrarium may then eat the coated insects, consuming the beneficial vitamin supplement powder as well.  \\n     [0025] The reptile feeder is advantageous because it provides an easy way for causing reptiles and amphibians to obtain valuable supplements. Alternative methods of feeding reptiles and amphibians a powder supplement are messy, and large portions of excess powder are wasted. However, with the present invention, excess powder that is left within the chamber  28  can be reused because it is retained within the feeder and it does not come into contact with anything outside of the feeding rock that may contaminate it. The feeder also prevents the growth of dangerous bacteria that can form on objects within the terrarium if a vitamin residue remains. This is especially dangerous in humid terrarium conditions.  \\n     [0026] An additional benefit of this invention is that it simulates the natural feeding behavior of reptiles and amphibians. Because the insects are contained within the feeder, the reptile or amphibian must wait until the insects exit it, through the insect port  22 . The animal is still required to hunt the insect in the terrarium. Thus despite the fact that the reptile or amphibian is confined to a domesticated environment in the terrarium, natural feeding behavior still prevails.  \\n     [0027] The reptile feeder provides a method and apparatus for feeding a reptile or amphibian live insects that carry a vitamin supplement powder. It provides a method for reducing the amount of supplement powder waste, and it reduces the mess associated with powder supplements, all the while simulating the animal&#39;s natural feeding behavior.  \\n     [0028] Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only, and the scope of the claims should be determined by the appended claims and their equivalents.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004112575-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"Circulation system for the coolant in an oil cooler ( 13 ) adapted to cool down the oil of the automatic transmission ( 2 ) of a motor vehicle in which the drain conduit ( 15 ) for the coolant from the oil cooler ( 13 ) of the transmission ( 2 ) is connected to said return conduit from the radiator, and that the exit mouth ( 16 ), of said drain conduit is inserted in the return conduit forming an angle A, said angle being more than 0\\u00b0 and less than 90\\u00b0.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"1 .

However, said oil coolers need an auxiliary electric pump and its relative installation and control system in case it is not possible, for any reasons (water too hot, connection problems, etc) to place them into the cooling circuit of the motor, upstream and next to the main water pump.  \\n       [0005] The overall installation costs are therefore significantly increased, and there are more risks of failure and of high operation load for the battery.  \\n       [0006] It is an object of the present invention to provide a circulation system for the coolant of an oil cooler that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks.  \\n       [0007] Said object is achieved by means of a circulation system for the coolant in an oil cooler as claimed in claim  1 . \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     [0008] Additional characteristics and advantages will become clear from the following description referring to the appended drawings provided as non-restrictive example and in which:  \\n     [0009]FIG. 1 is a plant view of a scheme of a cooling system for the engine of a motor I) vehicle, including the circulation system according to the invention, and  \\n     [0010]FIG. 2 is a magnified section view of a detail of the system shown in FIG. 1. \\n    \\n    \\n     [0011] With reference to the figures, reference number  1  indicates schematically an engine for a motor vehicle provided with automatic transmission  2  containing oil. The cooling system of the engine  1 , here schematically shown, includes a radiator  4  provided with an expansion tank for the coolant  5 , generally consisting of water mixed with antifreezing fluid, a thermostat  6  connected to the radiator by means of a delivery conduit  7  and a return conduit  8 . The return conduit further connects said thermostat  6  to the pump  9  for the coolant, which guarantees the circulation of the coolant itself in the engine. The system further consists of a heater  11  for the passenger compartment and of an oil cooler, both being fed by the coolant pump under control of the thermostat  6 .  \\n     [0012] The automatic transmission  2  is provided with its own oil cooler  13  where the circulation of the water, according to the invention, is achieved as disclosed in the following, not by means of a pump but thanks to the flow of the coolant in the delivery conduit from the thermostat to the pump of the main circuit. Said conduit is the one where the flow is constant and higher in intensity.  \\n     [0013] The oil cooler  13  of the transmission is therefore provided with a delivery conduit  14  for the coolant, which is got connecting said conduit to the return conduit  8  from the radiator  4 , that is from the conduit where the coolant presents the most suitable temperature for the whole system. The drain conduit  15  of the oil cooler  13  is connected to the part of the return conduit  8  from the thermostatic device  6  to the pump  9  for the coolant.  \\n     [0014] In order to take maximum advantage from the flow of the fluid sucked by the w pump  9 , the connection of the drain  15  to the return conduit is to be realised as described in the following description referring to FIG. 2.  \\n     [0015] The end of the conduit  15  is to be sectioned in a direction which is basically perpendicular to its own axis, and the mouth  16  of the conduit is to be introduced into the conduit  8  until it reaches its central axis, where the flow of the coolant is higher, forming an angle A with the axis of said conduit  8 , said angle being more than 0\\u00b0 and less than 90\\u00b0, preferably between 40\\u00b0 and 50\\u00b0, when measured from the side of the oil cooler.  \\n     [0016] With this arrangement, the flow of the fluid in the conduit  8  creates a vortex at the mouth  16  of the conduit  15 , said vortex generating a depression which can suck the fluid inside the conduit  15  and consequently produce a cooling circulation in the oil cooler  13  associated to the automatic transmission  2 , with no need of an auxiliary pump.  \\n     [0017] The invention is obviously not limited to the embodiment here described and can be realised in equivalent ways without going beyond the scope of the present invention.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004117551-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"An array configuration is provided for a multiple disk-arrays system containing at least one disk array.

Description of Related Art  \\n       [0004] The rapid market growth of information products has urged the development of new technologies and new specifications in information industry. As to data storage device, the data transfer rate and data safety are important issues. Therefore, RAID (redundant array of independent disk) is proposed to meet above demands. RAID 0 (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks level 0) array provides the function of data striping to boost the data access speed. RAID 1 array provides the function of data mirroring to ensure security and safety of data storage and system stability. In addition, RAID 0+1 array, a combination of RAID 0 array plus RAID 1 array, has advantages in both data transfer speed and data security.  \\n       [0005]FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of a disk array  14  connected to a computer  12 . The disk array  14  mainly comprises a disk-array controller  141 , a plurality of disk drives including a first disk drive  161 , a second disk drive  162 , a third disk drive  165  and a fourth disk drive  167 , connected to the computer  12  through the disk-array controller  141 . Similarly, the computer  12  accesses the plurality of disk drives through the disk-array controller  141 .  \\n       [0006] In prior art disk array, the disk of each disk driver has a sector arrangement as shown in FIG. 2. The first sector of each driver is configured as an array configuration sector  221  for the disk driver in which the configuration of the disk array is stored. The sector next to the array configuration sector  221  is configured as MBR (master boot record) sector  223 . The remaining sectors are configured into a plurality of data sectors begun from a first data sector  225  and ended by a last data sector  229 .  \\n       [0007] The disk array architecture and sector arrangement described above are only feasible for single disk array system and are problematic for multiple disk-array system (a system with multiple disk arrays). The placement of array configuration sector in first sector of the disk precludes the possibility for stand-alone use. Once being removed from the disk array, the data in the disk cannot be accessed.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0008] It is an object of the invention to provide an array configuration for multiple disk-array system to provide more flexible use for disk of the system.  \\n       [0009] In one aspect of the invention, an array signature field, an array information and a disk information are stored in last sector of a disk in this system. A disk can be added to or removed from a disk array while the original data is safely kept.  \\n       [0010] In another aspect of the invention, serial check sum of each disk in the same disk array is stored in the array configuration to fast identify status of disk array and relationship among the disks.  \\n       [0011] In still another aspect of the invention, the array configuration is well organized to save disk space.  \\n       [0012] To achieve above object and aspects, the array configuration of the present invention comprises an array signature field for identifying a disk relevant to one of disk arrays and span arrays, an array information for recording at least one setting and at least one status on the disk array; a disk information for recording at least one information in each disk of each disk array; and a serial check sum of each disk in same disk array.  \\n       [0013] The various objects and advantages of the present invention will be more readily understood from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the appended drawing, in which: \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS  \\n     [0014]FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of prior art disk array;  \\n     [0015]FIG. 2 shows the sector arrangement of prior art disk array;  \\n     [0016]FIG. 3 shows a schematic block diagram of a multiple disk-array system;  \\n     [0017]FIG. 4 shows the sector arrangement for each disk in the multiple disk-arrays system;  \\n     [0018]FIG. 5 shows the array configuration according to the present invention;  \\n     [0019]FIG. 6 shows the array information for each bit therein according to the present invention; and  \\n     [0020]FIG. 7 shows the disk information for each bit therein according to the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n     [0021]FIG. 3 shows a schematic block diagram of a multiple disk-array system used to explain the array configuration for multiple disk-array system according to the present invention. FIG. 4 shows the sector arrangement for each disk in the multiple disk-arrays system. In this system, a computer  32  is connected to a plurality of disk arrays and a plurality of independent disk drives in a span array through an interface card  34 . The plurality of disk arrays includes a first disk array  36 , a second disk array  37  and a third disk array  38 . To access data in the disks of the disk arrays or the span array, the computer firstly finds an accessing address of the data in corresponding disk, and then accesses the disks of the disk arrays or the span array through the adaptor card  34 .  \\n     [0022] The plurality of disk arrays can be disk arrays of the same category or disk arrays of different categories. The first disk array  36  is a RAID 0 array which includes a first stripe disk  361  and a second stripe disk  363 . The second disk array  37  is a RAID 0+1 array, which comprises a first stripe disk  371 , a second stripe disk  373 , a first mirror disk  375 , and a second mirror disk  377 . The third disk array  18  is a RAID 1 array, which comprises a source disk  381 , a mirror disk  383 , and a spare disk  385 . The disk drives in the span array include a first disk drive  391  and a second disk drive  393 .  \\n     [0023] In sector arrangement of disk in prior disk array system, the first sector is configured as the array configuration sector. In the present invention, the first sector is configured as the MBR sector, and following sectors are first data sector  423 , second data sector  425 , etc. In the present invention, the last sector for each disk in the disk array is array configuration sector and used for storing array configuration.  \\n     [0024] When a data is to be written in to a disk, the sectors at front portion of the disk are firstly accessed. Therefore, the last sector has the minimal possibility to access. When the array configuration is stored in the last sector of a disk in a disk array such as RADD 1 array, the disk can be removed and used as independent disk. A disk already stored with data can also be safely added to a disk array such as RADD 1 array. The original data stored in the disk added to the disk array will not be ruined. Therefore, the arrangement of the array configuration in the last sector of a disk renders the disk with flexible usage.  \\n     [0025]FIG. 5 shows the array configuration, which comprises an array signature field, a version identification field, an array information/disk information, a plurality of serial check sums of every disk in the same disk array, and a serial check sum of the array configuration.  \\n     [0026] The array signature field is stored in offset 0 position of the array configuration with the data type of one word (16 bits). The array signature field is stored with a specific value (such as AA55h) to identify a disk in a disk array. For example, if one word of data, started from offset 0 of the array configuration stored in the last sector of a disk, is stored with the value AA55h, the disk belongs to a disk array. The version identification field is stored in offset 2 position of the array configuration with the data type of one byte. The version identification field is used to record the version of firmware or software in the disk array system. The array information/disk information is stored in the offset 3 position of the array configuration with the data type of 15 bytes. The array information/disk information is used to record data and status of the disk array and the disks thereof.  \\n     [0027] The serial check sum of each disk in the same disk array is stored in offset 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46 position of the array configuration with the data type of DWORD (double word, 32 bits). The serial check sum of each disk is obtained according to an numeration on the model number, serial number, and firmware revision number of the disk. The serial check sum of each disk is nearly different to each other and can be used to identify the disk in a disk array. Moreover, the data field for serial check sum of disks contains a plurality of serial check sums in the sequence of disks in the disk array. The disks in the same array have the same data field for serial check sum of disks. Therefore, this data field can be used to identity the array. Moreover, the adaptor card  34  can identify the disk array, the sequence, function and relationship of disks in the array by this data field for serial check sum of disks. The removal and damage of disk in the disk array can also be identified by this data field. The serial check sum of array configuration is stored in the offset 50 position of the array configuration with the data type of one byte, which is obtained according to an operation on the entire array configuration to examine the integrity of the array configuration.  \\n     [0028]FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 respectively depict the array information of each disk array and the disk information of each disk in the array configuration in more detail.

Field of the Invention  \\n       [0002] The present invention relates generally to semiconductor circuit devices and, more particularly, to a voltage boosting circuit incorporated in a semiconductor circuit device.  \\n       [0003] 2. Description of the Related Art  \\n       [0004] In recent years, there have been provided dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) which have a voltage boosting circuit in a chip and In which memory cells are driven through word lines or other wiring by using a voltage boosted by the voltage boosting circuit. There has been a challenge to reduce current noise in this kind of voltage boosting circuit. Conventional voltage boosting circuits designed to reduce current noise and to obtain a sufficiently high boosted voltage include an oscillator circuit which generates a plurality of oscillating signals having different timing from each other and a plurality of pumping circuits each having a capacitor of a small capacitance and transistors of a small size in corresponding to the respective oscillating signals.  \\n       [0005]FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a conventional voltage boosting circuit. Referring to FIG. 1, boosting circuit  100  has oscillator circuit  120 , oscillator output signal latch circuit  130 , pumping circuit  140 , and boosted voltage level determination circuit  150 . Each of these circuits has the ground level as a reference potential and operates by an external power supply voltage VCC.  \\n       [0006] Oscillator output signal latch circuit  130  includes \\u03c6 1  latch circuit  131 , \\u03c6 2  latch circuit  132 , . . . , and \\u03c6n latch circuit  13   n . Pumping circuit  140  includes \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit  141 , \\u03c6 2  pumping circuit  142 , . . . , and \\u03c6n pumping circuit  14   n.    \\n       [0007] Signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n sent from oscillator circuit  120  are respectively given to \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  131 - 13   n . Signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA respectively sent from \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  131 - 13   n  are respectively given to \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n . The outputs of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  are connected to a common point, at which a boosted voltage VPP is generated. A signal VPUP sent from boosted level determination circuit  150  is given to oscillator circuit  120  and to the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  131 - 13   n.    \\n       [0008] A desired voltage to be obtained by boosting is set in boosting circuit  100 . Boosted level determination circuit  150  compares the boosted voltage VPP provided from the boosting circuit  100  with a set voltage sets the signal VPUP to \\u201cH\\u201d when the boosted voltage VPP is lower than the set voltage, and sets the signal VPUP to \\u201cL\\u201d when the boosted voltage VPP is higher than the set voltage.  \\n       [0009] Oscillator circuit  120  sends a plurality of oscillating signals one after another at equally shifted times when the signal VPUP Is at \\u201cH\\u201d. For example, oscillator circuit  120  has inverters forming n stages (n: an odd number) connected in a chain configuration. Oscillator circuit  120  sends no oscillating signal when the signal VPUP is at \\u201cL\\u201d.  \\n       [0010]FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a basic configuration of the oscillator circuit. Referring to FIG. 2, Oscillator circuit  120  has a basic configuration in which odd number of inverters being connected in a ring-like chain. The inverters send signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n. In FIG. 2, a circuit portion relating to signal VPUP is not shown.  \\n       [0011]FIG. 3 is a timing chart showing the waveforms of signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n. Referring to FIG. 3, signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n are oscillating signals which have transition timings successively shifted and phases alternately reversed. The cycle of each of signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n is T. The time between edges of the adjacent signals, e.g., between the rising edge of the signal \\u03c6 1  and the falling edge of signal \\u03c6 2  is dT=T/(2\\u00d7n), which is the waveform transmission time by the inverters.  \\n       [0012] Each of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  131 - 13   n  constituting oscillator output signal latch circuit  130  uses signal VPUP as an enable signal. \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  131 - 13   n  send signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n respectively as signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA when signal VPUP is at \\u201cH\\u201d. At this time, signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA are respectively in phase with signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n. \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  131 - 13   n  hold the states of signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA when signal VPUP is at \\u201cL\\u201d.  \\n       [0013] \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  constituting the pumping circuit  140  are respectively supplied with signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6nA and perform boosting operations in synchronization with signals \\u03c6A-\\u03c6nA. The output terminals of the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  are connected to the common point, i.e., the output terminal of pumping circuit  140 , through which boosted voltage VPP is output.  \\n       [0014]FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram showing an example of the configuration of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits. All of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits are identical in configuration. In FIG. 4, \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit is shown as a representative. Referring to FIG. 4, \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit is constituted by inverters INV 0  and INV 1 , capacitor C 0 , and diodes DI 0  and DI 1 .  \\n       [0015] Signal \\u03c6 1 A is given to inverter INV 0 . Inverters INV 0  and INV 1  are connected in series. The output terminal of inverter INV 1  and one terminal of capacitor C 0  are connected to each other at a connection point A. The other terminal of the capacitor C 0 , the cathode of diode DI 0  and the anode of diode DI 1  are connected to each other at a connection point B. External power supply voltage VCC is supplied to the anode of diode DI 0 . The cathodes of diodes DI 1  of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  are connected to the common point through which boosted voltage VPP is output.  \\n       [0016]FIG. 5 is a timing chart showing the boosting operation of \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit shown in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 5, signal \\u03c6 1 A is an oscillating signal having external power supply voltage VCC and reference voltage GND alternately sent. The signal waveform at the connection point A is slightly delayed from signal \\u03c6 1 A.  \\n       [0017] When the potential at the connection point A is reference voltage GND level, the connection point B is precharged to external power supply voltage VCC through diode DI 0 . When a transition from reference voltage GND to external power supply voltage VCC is effected at the connection point A, the potential at the connection point B is increased by an amount corresponding to external power supply voltage VCC due to the coupling through capacitor C 0 . Accordingly, a transition of the potential at the connection point B is made from external power supply voltage VCC to a voltage (2\\u00d7VCC) twice external power supply voltage VCC. Thus, \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit  141  can generate boosted voltage VPP higher than external power supply voltage VCC. The circuit for control of diodes DI 0  and DI 1  shown in FIG. 4 is not illustrated.  \\n       [0018] In general, the inverter is made by combining a Pch transistor (not shown) and an Nch transistor (not shown). Capacitor C 0  is charged by supply of a current caused by external power supply voltage VCC to flow through the Pch transistor of inverter INV 1 . Capacitor C 0  is discharged by the flow of a current from the connection point A to reference voltage GND through the Nch transistor of inverter INV 1 .  \\n       [0019] Similarly, the connection point B is precharged to external power supply voltage VCC by supply of a current caused by external power supply voltage VCC to flow to the connection point B through diode DI 0 .  \\n       [0020] The gate capacity of inverter INV 1  is charged and discharged by a charge current caused by external power supply voltage VCC to flow from inverter INV 0  to inverter INV 1  and a discharge current caused to flow from inverter INV 1  to reference voltage GND.  \\n       [0021] In the voltage boosting circuit, noise is caused due to the charge current from external power supply voltage VCC and the discharge current to reference voltage GND.  \\n       [0022] An electric charge which can be sent from the \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit for boosting is determined by the capacitance of capacitor C 0 . It is necessary that the sizes of the transistors constituting inverters INV 1  and INV 0  and diodes DI 0  and DI 1 , which drives e capacitor C 0 , are determined such that capacitor C 0  can be efficiently charged and discharged. To obtain suitable boosted signal VPP, the pumping power could be increased, and a large pumping capacitor and large transistors for a circuit such as inverter for driving the capacitor could be used. In such a case, however, charge/discharge current noise of capacitor CO would be increased.  \\n       [0023] To obtain a sufficiently high boosting effect while limiting current noise, the voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 1 is arranged in such a manner that oscillator circuit  120  has a plurality of outputs and a plurality of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  each having a capacitor of a small capacitance and transistors of a small size are provided.  \\n       [0024] Description will be made of the operation of the conventional voltage boosting circuit.  \\n       [0025]FIG. 6 is a timing chart for explaining the operation of the conventional voltage boosting circuit. FIG. 6 shows the waveforms of signal VPUP, signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n sent from oscillator circuit  120  and signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6n sent from latch circuits  131 - 13   n.    \\n       [0026] Referring to FIG. 6, signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n and \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA are maintained at a constant value and do not make no transition at time T0 since signal VPUP is at \\u201cL\\u201d.  \\n       [0027] Signal VPUP makes a transition from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d in the time period from time T0 to time Ts to start an initialization operation of the voltage boosting circuit.  \\n       [0028] When the initialization operation of the voltage boosting circuit is started, oscillator circuit  120  sends n oscillating signals, at times successively shifted by the time period corresponding to cycle T. The length of each of time periods Ta and Tb in FIG. 6 is equal to cycle T.  \\n       [0029] Signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n are supplied respectively as signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA to pumping circuit  140  by latch circuits  131 - 13   n  in oscillator output signal latch circuit  130 . \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  constituting the pumping circuit  140  perform the boosting operations in response to the transitions of signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA. The outputs from the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  ar combined to supply boosted voltage VPP to the outside. Signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA each make transitions from reference potential GND to external power supply voltage VCC at different times, so that no coincidence of current noise peaks occurs.  \\n       [0030]FIG. 7 is a timing chart showing the operation of the conventional voltage boosting circuit and the waveform of the output signal. FIG. 7 illustrates a case where n=5 and where pumping circuits each configured with two of the circuit that shown in FIG. 4 so that the boosting circuit operates not only at the time of transition from reference voltage GND to external power supply voltage VCC but also at the time of transition from external power supply voltage VCC to reference voltage GND.  \\n       [0031] In the lower section of FIG. 7, the waveforms of signal VPUP and signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6 5 A are shown. In the upper section of FIG. 7, currents I (solid line) sent from \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  and a current Itotal (dotted line) obtained by combining currents I are shown.  \\n       [0032] Referring to FIG. 7, signal VPUP makes a transition from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d in the time period from time T0 to time T1 to start the boosting operation. At time T1, signal \\u03c6 1 A makes a transition from GND to VCC. Subsequently, signals \\u03c6 2 A-\\u03c6 5 A make transitions one after another at intervals of time T2\\u2212T1=dT=(one cycle T)/(2\\u00d75). Thereafter, signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6 5 A make transitions alternately to GND and VCC at times shifted by dT. As can be understood from FIG. 7, the transition waveforms of the odd-numbered signals \\u03c6 1 A, \\u03c6 3 A, and \\u03c6 5 A are in reversed phase with respect to those of the even-numbered signals \\u03c6 2 A and \\u03c6 4 A.  \\n       [0033] In response to the transitions of signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA, transitions of currents I (solid line) output from \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  are made. Current Itotal (dotted line) obtained by combining the outputs from the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  rises during the time period from T1 to T4 and is generally constant after time T5. Current Itotal after time T5 is a saturated consumption current I 0 . The consumption current at the time of starting of the pumping circuit when signal VPUP makes a transition from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d has a current changing rate dI/dT in the time period from T1 to T4, which is considered to be a noise source. This is because, if the current changing rate dI/dT is large, noise due to the inductance of wiring including the lead frame of the semiconductor device is large.  \\n       [0034] Another conventional voltage boosting circuit, e.g., one described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-25673 has a delay circuit which generates signals corresponding to signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA shown in FIG. 1.  \\n       [0035] A further conventional voltage boosting circuit has two operating modes: a standby mode and an active mode (e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-320268). In this kind of voltage boosting circuit, one of the two operating modes is selected according to the amount of electric charge to be supplied.  \\n       [0036] The voltage boosting circuit described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-320268 has a plurality of pumping circuits. In the standby mode, only part of the pumping circuits are successively operated. In the active mode, all the pumping circuits are continuously operated.  \\n       [0037] The above-described conventional arts have problems described below.  \\n       [0038] The conventional voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 1 is arranged to reduce current noise in such a manner that oscillator circuit  120  has a plurality of outputs and pumping circuit  140  is constituted by \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  141 - 14   n  having a capacitor of a small capacitance and transistors of a small size. After a lapse of a certain length of time from a start of the operation, therefore, the current value becomes generally constant and the current changing rate dI/dT becomes zero, as shown in FIG. 7. Thus, noise due to the current changing rate dI/dT becomes zero.  \\n       [0039] However, when the pumping operation is started, the rate of change in current (dI/dT) of the conventional boosting circuit is high, as shown in FIG. 7. An abrupt current change (dI/dT) of external power supply voltage VCC or reference voltage GND can cause noise by a self-inductance or a mutual inductance.  \\n       [0040] In semiconductor circuit devices such as DRAMs, a lead frame and bonding wires for connection between pins and a chip exist. Also, wires for external power supply voltage VCC and reference voltage GND exist adjacent to wires to address and data pins or the like. Therefore, the characteristics of input of addresses, data or the like are degraded by the noise from the wires.  \\n       [0041] In the conventional voltage boosting circuit described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-25673, a delay circuit is used. The delay time of the delay circuit, however, varies under the influence of manufacturing process variations. In the voltage boosting circuit arranged as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-25673, therefore, there is a possibility of nonuniformity of the currents consumed by the pumping circuits during one cycle of the oscillation signals generated by the oscillator. The output of the oscillator circuit described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-25673 is a signal taken out from one point and is supplied to the pumping circuits with delays added by the delay circuit. The signal passed through the delay circuit is susceptible to the influence of the above-mentioned process variations, there is a tendency toward nonuniformity in the time periods during which the pumping operations are performed in one oscillating cycle, and it is difficult to perform control with accuracy. In some cases, therefore, failure to control the current changing rate dI/dT within the desired gradient range occurs, which is a cause of generation of noise. There is a possibility of the current changing rate dI/dT becoming considerably large at the time of starting of the operation in particular.  \\n       [0042] The conventional voltage boosting circuit described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-320268 has the two operating modes, i.e., the standby mode and the active mode, for the boosting operation. This voltage boosting circuit controls the current supply capacity by changing the number of pumping circuits with respect to different consumption currents from VPP in the operating modes. However, the operation of this voltage boosting circuit at the time of starting of the operation is the same as that of the voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 1, In that the pumping circuits (pumping means) perform boosting at times successively shifted by the delay circuit (delay element). Therefore, the changing rate dI/dT in consumption current at the time of starting of the voltage boosting circuit described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-320268 is as steep as the changing dI/dT in current Itotal shown in FIG. 7.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0043] An object of the present invention is to provide a voltage boosting circuit in which an abrupt change in current at the time of starting of the operation is limited to reduce noise.  \\n       [0044] To achieve the above-described object, according to the present invention, there is provided a voltage boosting circuit having an oscillator circuit, a pumping circuit, a boosting power control circuit and an enable circuit. The oscillator circuit outputs a plurality of oscillating signals differing in edge timing from each other. A plurality of pumping circuits are provided in correspondence with oscillating signals. Each pumping circuit performs a boosting operation by charging and discharging a pumping capacitor by using the corresponding one of the oscillating signals. The pumping circuits generate a boosted voltage by combining their outputs signals. The boosting power control circuit controls the boosting power of each pumping circuit according to an enable signal. An enable circuit counts the number of edges of at least one of the oscillating signals, and generates the enable signal to instruct the boosting power control circuit to reduce the boosting power of the pumping circuit until the count value becomes a set value.  \\n       [0045] According to the present invention, the boosting power of at least one of the plurality of pumping circuits for performing boosting operations by a plurality of oscillated signals is restricted for several cycles of the signal after a start of the boosting operation by the enable circuit and the boosting power control circuit. A rate of a change in the current for the boosting operation is thereby reduced to suppress noise accompanying the change in the current.  \\n       [0046] The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description with references to the accompanying drawings which illustrate examples of the present invention. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0047]FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a conventional voltage boosting circuit;  \\n     [0048]FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a basic configuration of an oscillator circuit shown in FIG. 1;  \\n     [0049]FIG. 3 is a timing chart showing the waveforms of oscillating signals of the oscillator circuit shown in FIG. 1;  \\n     [0050]FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram showing an example of the configuration of each of pumping circuits shown in FIG. 1;  \\n     [0051]FIG. 5 is a timing chart showing the boosting operation of the pumping circuit shown in FIG. 4;  \\n     [0052]FIG. 6 is a timing chart for explaining the operation of the conventional voltage boosting circuit;  \\n     [0053]FIG. 7 is a timing chart showing the operation of the conventional voltage boosting circuit and the waveform of the output signal;  \\n     [0054]FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a voltage boosting circuit in an embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0055]FIG. 9 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a basic configuration of an oscillator circuit;  \\n     [0056]FIG. 10 is a timing chart showing the waveforms of oscillating signals sent from the oscillator circuit;  \\n     [0057]FIG. 11 is a circuit diagram showing an example of the configuration of each of pumping circuits;  \\n     [0058]FIG. 12 is a timing chart showing the boosting operation of the pumping circuit shown in FIG. 11;  \\n     [0059]FIG. 13 is a circuit diagram showing another example of the configuration of each pumping circuit;  \\n     [0060]FIG. 14 is a timing chart showing the operation of the voltage boosting circuit in the embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0061]FIG. 15 is a timing chart showing the waveforms of signals in the voltage boosting circuit in the embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0062]FIG. 16 is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a voltage boosting circuit in another embodiment of the present invention; and  \\n     [0063]FIG. 17 is a timing chart showing the operation of the voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 16. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0064] An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.  \\n     [0065]FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram showing a voltage boosting circuit in an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 8, boosting circuit  10  has oscillator circuit  20 , oscillator output signal latch circuit  30 , pumping circuit  40 , boosted voltage level determination circuit  50 , and enable circuit  60 . Each of these circuits operates by a reference potential GND and an external power supply voltage VCC.  \\n     [0066] Oscillator output signal latch circuit  30  includes \\u03c6 1  latch circuit  31 ,  12  latch circuit  32 , . . . , and \\u03c6n latch circuit  3   n , where n is an odd number. Pumping circuit  40  includes \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit  41 , \\u03c6 2  pumping circuit  42 , . . . , and \\u03c6n pumping circuit  4   n.    \\n     [0067] Enable circuit  60  has edge counter  70  and AND gates  62 - 6 (n\\u22121).  \\n     [0068] Signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n sent from oscillator circuit  20  are respectively given to the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  31 - 3   n . The signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) are also input to edge counter  70 . Signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA respectively sent from \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  31 - 3   n  are respectively given to \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  41 - 4   n . Outputs of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  41 - 4   n  are connected to a common point, at which a boosted voltage VPP is generated. A signal VPUP sent from boosted level determination circuit  50  is input to the oscillator circuit  20 , \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  131 - 13   n , edge counter  70  and AND gates  62 - 6 (n\\u22121).  \\n     [0069] A desired voltage to be obtained by boosting is set in boosting circuit  10 .  \\n     [0070] Boosted level determination circuit  50  compares the boosted voltage VPP with a set voltage, sets the signal VPUP to \\u201cH\\u201d when the boosted voltage VPP is lower than the set voltage, and sets the signal VPUP to \\u201cL\\u201d when the boosted voltage VPP is higher than the set voltage.  \\n     [0071] Oscillator circuit  20  sends a plurality of oscillated signals one after another at equally shifted times when the signal VPUP is at \\u201cH\\u201d. For example, oscillator circuit  20  has inverters forming an odd number of stages by being connected in a chain configuration. Oscillator circuit  20  sends no oscillating signal when the signal VPUP is at \\u201cL\\u201d.  \\n     [0072]FIG. 9 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a basic configuration of the oscillator circuit. Referring to FIG. 9, oscillator circuit  20  has a basic configuration in which inverters forming an odd number of stages are connected in a ring-like chain. The inverters send signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n to oscillator output signal latch circuit  30  and to enable circuit  60 . The number of inverter stages only have to be an odd number; n may be, but not limited to, 3, 5 or 7. In FIG. 9, a circuit portion relating to signal VPUP is not shown.  \\n     [0073]FIG. 10 is a timing chart showing the waveforms of signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n. Referring to FIG. 10, signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n are oscillated signals which have transition timings successively shifted and phase alternately reversed. The cycle of each of signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n is T. The time between edges of the adjacent signals, e.g., between the rising edge of the signal \\u03c6 1  and the falling edge of signal \\u03c6 2  is dT=T/(2\\u00d7n), which is the waveform transmission time of one stage of the inverters.  \\n     [0074] Each of \\u03c6 1  and \\u03c6n latch circuits  31  and  3   n  constituting oscillator output signal latch circuit  30  uses signal VPUP as an enable signal. \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) latch circuits  32 - 3 (n\\u22121) use signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN as enable signals. \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  31 - 3   n  send signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n as signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA when the enable signal is at \\u201cH\\u201d. At this time, signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA are in phase respectively with signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n. \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  31 - 3   n  hold the states when the enable signal is at \\u201cL\\u201d. The number of latch stages in \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n latch circuits  31 - 3   n  may be freely selected and may be either an odd number or an even number.  \\n     [0075] Oscillator output signal latch circuit  30  controls the boosting power of pumping circuit  40  in a reduction manner by delaying the supply of signals \\u03c6 2 A-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)A to pumping circuit  40  by the time period corresponding to several cycles in a transient state at the time of starting of boosting.  \\n     [0076] \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  41 - 4   n  constituting pumping circuit  40  are respectively supplied with signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA and perform boosting operations in synchronization with signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA. Output terminals of the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  41 - 4   n  are connected to the common point, i.e., the output terminal of pumping circuit  40 , through which boosted voltage VPP is output.  \\n     [0077]FIG. 11 is a circuit diagram showing an example of the configuration of the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits. All the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits are identical in configuration. In FIG. 11, the \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit is shown as a representative. Referring to FIG. 11, the \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit is constituted by inverters INV 0  and INV 1 , capacitor C 0 , and diodes DI 0  and DI 1 . The capacitor C 0  is a pumping capacitor for performing the boosting operation by pumping.  \\n     [0078] Signal \\u03c6 1 A is given to inverter INV 0 . Inverters INV 0  and INV 1  are connected in series. The output terminal of inverter INV 1  and one terminal of capacitor C 0  are connected to each other at a connection point A. The other terminal of capacitor C 0 , the cathode of diode DI 0  and the anode of diode DI 1  are connected to each other at a connection point B. External power supply voltage VCC is supplied to the anode of diode DI 0 . The cathodes of diodes DI 1  of \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits  41 - 4   n  are connected to the common point through which boosted voltage VPP is output.  \\n     [0079]FIG. 12 is a timing chart showing the boosting operation of the \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit shown in FIG. 11. Referring to FIG. 12, signal \\u03c6 1 A is an oscillating signal having external power supply voltage VCC and reference voltage GND alternately sent. The signal waveform at the connection point A is slightly delayed from signal \\u03c6 1 A.  \\n     [0080] When the potential at the connection point A is reference voltage GND level, the connection point B is precharged to external power supply voltage VCC through diode DI 0 . When a transition from reference voltage GND to external power supply voltage VCC is effected at the connection point A, capacitor C 0  at the connection point B is increased by an amount corresponding to the difference in amplitude between GND and VCC. Accordingly, transitions of the potential at the connection point B are alternately made to external power supply voltage VCC and a voltage (2\\u00d7VCC) twice external power supply voltage VCC. Thus, \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit  41  can generate boosted voltage VPP higher than external power supply voltage VCC.  \\n     [0081]FIG. 13 is a circuit diagram showing another example of the configuration of the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits. All the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits are identical in configuration. In FIG. 14, the \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit is shown as a representative. Referring to FIG. 14, the \\u03c6 1  pumping circuit is constituted by the pumping circuit shown in FIG. 11 and a pumping circuit which operates at the edge other than the edge at which the pumping circuit shown in FIG. 11 operates, the two pumping circuits being connected in parallel. In the pumping circuit shown In FIG. 13, the boosting operation is performed at each of the rising and falling edges of signal \\u03c6 1 A.  \\n     [0082] Edge counter  70  is supplied with signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121). After a start of oscillation of one of signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121), edge counter  70  counts the number of oscillating signals. When the count value becomes a predetermined set value, edge counter  70  sends an enable signal. The predetermined set value can be set for each of signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121). The logical sum of each enable signal and signal VPUP is obtained by the corresponding one of AND gates  62 - 6 (n\\u22121), and the logical sums thereby obtained are input respectively as signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN-the \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) latch circuits  32 - 3 (n\\u22121).  \\n     [0083] That is, each of \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) latch circuits  32 - 3 (n\\u22121) is supplied with the enable signal which rises with a delay that a predetermined set value times one cycle from the rising edge of signal VPUP. Oscillation of each of signals \\u03c6 2 A-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)A is thereby started at a time after an arbitrary multiple of cycle T from signal VPUP. Starting of the boosting operation of each of the \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) pumping circuits  42 - 4 (n\\u22121) is also delayed by the arbitrary multiple of cycle T.  \\n     [0084] As described above, voltage boosting circuit  10  is arranged so that the boosting operation of each of the pumping circuits corresponding to signals freely set is delayed by an arbitrary number of cycles. The change in current at the time of starting of the operation of voltage boosting circuit  10  is thereby limited to reduce noise. For example, input characteristics of signal lines of a DRAM using voltage boosting circuit  10  can therefore be improved.  \\n     [0085] In voltage boosting circuit  10  of this embodiment, the timing of starting of the boosting operation of each pumping circuit is performed by counting the number of the edges of an oscillated signal. Therefore, the timing is not easily influenced by manufacturing process variations and does not vary easily.  \\n     [0086] Since voltage boosting circuit  10  of this embodiment is arranged to delay a start of the boosting operation of each pumping circuit by the number of cycles obtained by counting the number of the edges of an oscillating signal, the changing rate of current can be reduced during operation at any clock rate to obtain a satisfactory effect. In contrast, in a case where a start of the boosting operation of each pumping circuit is adjusted, for example, by a delay circuit, there is a possibility of failure to obtain a satisfactory effect, depending on a clock rate used.  \\n     [0087] While an example of delay of starts of the boosting operation corresponding to signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) has been described, the boosting operation to be delayed in corresponding to any of the signals and the amount of delay may be freely selected.  \\n     [0088] The operation of voltage boosting circuit  10  of this embodiment will be described.  \\n     [0089]FIG. 14 is a timing chart showing the operation of voltage boosting circuit  10  of this embodiment. FIG. 14 shows the waveforms of signals VPUP, \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n, \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6nA, and \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN.  \\n     [0090] Boosted level determination circuit  50  compares boosted voltage VPP and the desired set voltage at all times, and sets signal VPUP to \\u201cL\\u201d (GND level) when boosted voltage VPP is higher than the set voltage. Referring to FIG. 14, signal VPUP is at \\u201cL\\u201d at time T0. At this point in time, therefore oscillator circuit  20  does not oscillate to enable voltage boosting circuit  10  to operate.  \\n     [0091] When boosted voltage VPP becomes lower than the set voltage, boosted voltage level determination circuit  50  sets signal VPUP to \\u201cH\\u201d. In the time period from time T0 in which signal VPUP changes from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d, as shown in FIG. 14, oscillator circuit  20  starts oscillating and voltage boosting circuit  10  starts the boosting operation.  \\n     [0092] When oscillator  20  starts oscillation, oscillating waveforms such as shown in FIG. 14 appear in signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n.  \\n     [0093] Since \\u03c6 1  latch circuit  31  uses signal VPUP as an enable signal, it directly supplies the oscillating waveform of signal \\u03c6 1  as signal \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6 1  pumping circuit  41  when signal VPUP becomes \\u201cH\\u201d. Since \\u03c6n latch circuit  3   n  also uses signal VPUP as an enable signal, it directly supplies the oscillating waveform of signal \\u03c6n as signal \\u03c6nA to \\u03c6n pumping circuit  4   n  when signal VPUP becomes \\u201cH\\u201d.  \\n     [0094] On the other hand, \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) latch circuits  32 - 3 (n\\u22121) use signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN as enable signals. Since each of signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN is a signal formed by delaying signal VPUP by an arbitrary multiple of cycle T, it does not become \\u201cH\\u201d immediately after signal VPUP has become \\u201cH\\u201d. In time period Ta shown in FIG. 14, each of signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN is still at \\u201cL\\u201d.  \\n     [0095] \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) latch circuits  32 - 3 (n\\u22121) hold the states of signals \\u03c6 2 A-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)A when signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN are at \\u201cL\\u201d. Therefore, signals \\u03c6 2 A-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)A are not oscillating immediately after oscillating waveforms have appeared in signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121).  \\n     [0096] The edge counter  70  counts the number of the edges of signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121). When the count becomes the set value, the corresponding one of signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN changes from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d. This set value is set in advance to the number of cycles by which signal VPUP is to be delayed. In time period Tb shown in FIG. 14, each of signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN makes a transition from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d.  \\n     [0097] When one of signals \\u03c6 2 OSEN-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)OSEN changes from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d, the corresponding one of the \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) latch circuits  32 - 3 (n\\u22121) directly supplies the corresponding one of signals \\u03c6 2 -\\u03c6(n\\u22121) as the corresponding one of signals \\u03c6 2 A-\\u03c6(n\\u22121)A to the corresponding one of pumping circuits  42 - 4 (n\\u22121).  \\n     [0098]FIG. 15 is a timing chart showing the waveforms of the signals in the voltage boosting circuit of this embodiment. FIG. 15 shows an example of the circuit in which n=5 and in which edge counter  70  operates only for signals \\u03c6 2  and \\u03c6 4  to start oscillation of signals \\u03c6 2 A and \\u03c6 4 A with a delay of only one cycle. It is also assumed that the pumping circuit shown in FIG. 13 is used to enable the voltage boosting circuit to operate not only at the times of transition of signals \\u03c6 1 A and \\u03c6 5 A from reference voltage GND to external power supply voltage VCC but also at the times of transition from external power supply voltage VCC to reference voltage GND.  \\n     [0099] In the lower section of FIG. 15, the waveforms of signal VPUP and \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6 5 A are shown. In the upper section of FIG. 15, currents I (solid line) sent from \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6 5  pumping circuits  41 - 45  and a current Itotal (dotted line) obtained by combining currents I are shown.  \\n     [0100] Referring to FIG. 15, signal VPUP makes a transition from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d in the time period from time T0 to time T1 to start the boosting operation. Signals \\u03c6 1 A, \\u03c6 3 A, and \\u03c6 5 A make transitions (rise) at times T1, T3, and T5, respectively, to start oscillation. Signals \\u03c6 2 A and \\u03c6 4 A do not make transitions (fall) at times T2 and T4 but are delayed by one cycle by the edge counter  70  to start oscillation until times T12 and T14.  \\n     [0101] In response to the transitions of signals \\u03c6 1 A-\\u03c6 5 A, transitions of currents I sent from \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6 5  pumping circuits  41 - 45  are made, as indicated by the solid line in FIG. 15. Current Itotal (indicated by the dotted line in FIG. 15) obtained by combining the outputs from \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6 5  pumping circuits  41 - 45  rises gradually in the time period from time T1 to time T13 to reach a saturated consumption current I 0  at time  14 , and is constantly maintained thereafter.  \\n     [0102] The saturated consumption current I 0  shown in FIG. 15 has the same value as the saturated consumption current I 0  in the example of the conventional art shown in FIG. 7. In the conventional art shown in FIG. 7, current Itotal increases abruptly in the time period from time T1 to time T5 to reach saturated consumption current I 0 . In contrast, in the case of this embodiment shown in FIG. 15, current Itotal increases gradually in the time period from time T1 to time T13 to reach saturated consumption current I 0 . That is, it can be understood that the changing rate of current dI/dT immediately after a start of the boosting operation is limited to a smaller value in this embodiment.  \\n     [0103] In voltage boosting circuit  10  of this embodiment, as described above, arbitrary ones of a plurality of oscillated signals sent from oscillator circuit  20  at the time of a start of the operation are delayed by arbitrary numbers of cycles by latch circuits  31 - 3   n  supplied with enable signals from the edge counter  70  which counts the number of the edges of each oscillated signal. The times at which the boosting operations of pumping circuits  41 - 4   n  are started are thereby shifted relative to each other to reduce the changing rate of current, thereby reducing noise. For example, the input characteristics of signal lines of a DRAM using voltage boosting circuit  10  are thereby prevented from being badly influenced by noise.  \\n     [0104] In voltage boosting circuit  10  of this embodiment, starting of the boosting operation of pumping circuits  41 - 4   n  is controlled in synchronization with the cycles of the oscillating signals by edge counter  70  which counts the number of the edges of the oscillating signals. A different arrangement is conceivable in which input signals to the pumping circuits are generated by delaying signal VPUP by a delay circuit constituted by inverters in a plurality of stages. It is also conceivable that enable signals to the latch circuits are generated by delaying signal VPUP through a delay circuit.  \\n     [0105] However, there is a possibility of occurrence of variations in the abilities of the inverters in a transistor manufacturing process and it is difficult to obtain a predetermined amount of delay with accuracy by selecting the number of inverter stages. If the amount of delay as needed is not obtained, there is a possibility of the current changing rate dI/dT becoming large at a certain time to cause noise. It can therefore be said that voltage boosting circuit  10  of this embodiment capable of controlling the timing of starting of the boosting operations of the pumping circuits is advantageous in comparison with any voltage boosting circuit using a delay circuit.  \\n     [0106] Another embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.  \\n     [0107]FIG. 16 is a circuit diagram showing a voltage boosting circuit in another embodiment of the present invention. For ease of explanation, only portion of the voltage boosting circuit relating to signal \\u03c6 2  of the signals sent from oscillator circuit  20  is illustrated in FIG. 16.  \\n     [0108] Referring to FIG. 16, the voltage boosting circuit has oscillator circuit  20 , edge counter  70 , \\u03c6 2  pumping circuit  42 , inverters INV 3  and INV 2  and gate CGATE. The voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 16 has a boosted voltage level determination circuit (not shown) for supplying VPUP signal, as does voltage boosting circuit  10  shown in FIG. 8. In the voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 16, a control Circuit for controlling the boosting power of pumping circuit  42  is constituted by inverters INV 2  and INV 3  and gate CGATE.  \\n     [0109] The voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 16 has circuits relating to signals \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n, although only the portion relating to signal \\u03c6 2  is illustrated.  \\n     [0110] Oscillator circuit  20 , the boosted voltage level determination circuit, edge counter  70  and the \\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6n pumping circuits are the same as those shown in FIG. 8.  \\n     [0111] inverter INV 3  is a NOT gate which inverts signal \\u03c6 2 OSEN sent from edge counter  70 .  \\n     [0112] Gate CGATE consists of a two-input NAND gate to which signal \\u03c6 2 A and signal \\u03c6 2 OSEN are input and a two-input NOR gate to which signal \\u03c6 2 A and an output from inverter INV 3  are input.  \\n     [0113] An output terminal of the two-input NAND gate is connected to a connection point C. An output terminal of the two-input NOR gate is connected to a connection point D.  \\n     [0114] Inverter INV 2  consists of p-channel transistor M 1  and n-channel transistor M 2  connected in series between external power supply voltage VCC and reference voltage GND. The gate of p-channel transistor M 1  is connected to the connection point C, while the gate of the n-channel transistor M 2  is connected to the connection point D. A connection point between the p-channel and n-channel transistors is connected to the connection point A in \\u03c6 2  pumping circuit  42 .  \\n     [0115]FIG. 17 is a timing chart showing the operation of the voltage boosting circuit shown in FIG. 16. FIG. 17 shows the waveforms of signals \\u03c6 2 A and \\u03c6 2 OSEN and waveforms at the connection points A and B immediately after a transition of signal VPUP from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d. The first one cycle of signal \\u03c6 2  output from oscillator circuit  20  after the transition of signal VPUP from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d is time period Ta, and the next cycle is time period Tb.  \\n     [0116] In time period Ta, signal \\u03c6 2 OSEN is at \\u201cL\\u201d and, therefore, the potentials at the connection points C and D corresponding to the output terminals of gate CGATE are \\u201cH\\u201d level and \\u201cL\\u201d level, respectively, even when signal \\u03c6 2 A is oscillating. Since p-channel transistor M 1  and n-channel transistor M 2  constituting gate INV 2  are connected to the point C and the point D, respectively, inverter INV 2  does not operate when signal \\u03c6 2 OSEN is at \\u201cL\\u201d.  \\n     [0117] In time period Tb, signal \\u03c6 2 OSEN makes a transition from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d and the signal \\u03c6 2 A oscillating operation is therefore transmitted to inverter INV 2  through the outputs (connection points C and D) of gate CGATE.  \\n     [0118] When signal \\u03c6 2 A is \\u201cL\\u201d, the inverter INV 1  discharges the connection point A and the capacitor C 0  to \\u201cL\\u201d. Also, while the potential at the connection point C of the gate CGATE is \\u201cH\\u201d level, the potential at the connection point D becomes \\u201cH\\u201d level. Therefore the n-channel transistor M 2  is turned on to enable the inverter INV 2  to also act to discharge the connection point A and the capacitor C 0  to \\u201cL\\u201d.  \\n     [0119] Conversely, when signal \\u03c6 2 A is at \\u201cH\\u201d, inverter INV 1  acts to charge the connection point A and capacitor C 0  to \\u201cH\\u201d, and inverter INV 2  also acts to charge them to \\u201cH\\u201d. That is, when signal \\u03c6 2 OSEN is at \\u201cH\\u201d, both inverters INV 1  and INV 2  charge or discharge the connection point A or capacitor C 0 .  \\n     [0120] Thus, in time period Tb, both inverters INV 1  and INV 2  charge or discharge the connection point A or capacitor C 0 . Therefore, when signal \\u03c6 2 A makes a transition from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d, and when it makes a transition from \\u201cH\\u201d to \\u201cL\\u201d, the operation can be performed without blunting the waveforms at the connection points A and B if the current capacities of inverters INV 1  and INV 2  are adjusted in advance. On the other hand, in time period Ta, only inverter INV 1  performs charging/discharging of the connection point A or capacitor C 0 . At this time, therefore, the waveforms at the points A and B are blunted in comparison with those in time period Tb. The amount of electric charge which can be supplied to boosted voltage VPP in time period Tb in which the boosting operation is performed by both inverters INV 1  and INV 2  is larger than that in time period Ta in which the boosting operation is performed by inverter INV 1  alone. The current for charging/discharging of the connection point A or capacitor C 0  in time period Tb is also larger than that in time period Ta, and the current changing rate dI/dT in time period Tb, considered to be a noise source, is also larger than that in time period Ta.  \\n     [0121] Consequently, in the voltage boosting circuit of this embodiment, it is possible to reduce noise by limiting the current changing rate at the time of starting of the operation in such a manner that the transistor size of inverter INV 2  is adjusted and the time period corresponding to the number of cycles during which signal \\u03c6 2 OSEN (\\u03c6 1 -\\u03c6nOSEN) is held at \\u201cL\\u201d after transition of signal VPUP from \\u201cL\\u201d to \\u201cH\\u201d is adjusted.  \\n     [0122] While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004144317-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"A mask assembly includes a frame and at least one linear element secured onto the frame.

Field of the Invention  \\n       [0002] The present invention relates to a mask used when forming a thin layer on a substrate, and a process of fabricating the mask.  \\n       [0003] 2. Description of the Related Art  \\n       [0004] Vapor deposition, sputtering, CVD and similar processes are used to form thin layers from various kinds of material. The thin layers are shaped to a certain pattern or configuration, depending upon a purpose of use. If the vapor deposition process is performed with a mask having a fine opening pattern, the vapor deposition process can make a thin layer having a desired pattern.  \\n       [0005] In this vapor deposition process, the mask is firmly attached to a substrate prior to vapor deposition. The material is then vapor-deposited on the substrate. The opening of the mask decides (controls) the area of vapor deposition so that a desired pattern of thin layer is made on the substrate. The mask is prepared by, for example, electroforming.  \\n       [0006] The process of making the mask by electroforming will be described. First, a plating substrate with photoresist thereon is prepared, and a fine pattern of resist is made on the substrate by photolithography (i.e., the pattern making process). As a result, some areas are covered with the resist and other areas are not on the substrate. Then, a metal is electro-deposited over the no resist areas on the plating substrate (i.e., the electroforming process). After the electroforming, the deposited metallic layer is removed from the substrate (i.e., the peeling or exfoliating process). The peeled metallic layer becomes the mask which has the opening of the same shape as the resist pattern.  \\n       [0007] In this manner, the mask has the opening that has a uniform width is prepared. This technique is disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai No. 10-305670.  \\n       [0008] The mask is thin so that the mask is easy to bend. Particularly, the mask bends as the mask becomes larger. If the mask bends during the layer forming process, the opening of the mask changes its shape so that the resulting layer does not have a desired pattern.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0009] According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an improved mask assembly having a predetermined opening pattern used to form a thin layer having the same pattern on a substrate. The mask assembly includes a frame having a window. The mask assembly also includes a masking part supported by an edge (periphery) of the window such that the masking part spans (bridges) the window of the frame. The masking part includes a plurality of shielding portions spaced from each other to form the predetermined opening pattern. Each shielding portion has at least one linear element. The shielding portion may have a plurality of parallel linear elements arranged next to each other.  \\n       [0010] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of making a mask assembly. The mask assembly has a predetermined opening pattern used to form a thin layer of the same pattern on a substrate. The method includes providing a masking part that includes a plurality of linear elements arranged next to each other. The method also includes removing predetermined one or more linear elements to form the predetermined opening pattern. Since which linear element(s) should be removed can be determined arbitrarily, it is possible to make the opening having a desired pattern.  \\n       [0011] Other objects, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains from the subsequent detailed description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0012]FIG. 1 illustrates a plan view of a mask assembly used for layer formation according to one embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0013]FIG. 2 illustrates a cross sectional view of a modified mask assembly according to the present invention;  \\n     [0014]FIG. 3 illustrates a cross sectional view of another modified mask assembly;  \\n     [0015]FIG. 4 illustrates a cross sectional view of still another modified mask assembly;  \\n     [0016]FIGS. 5A to  5 C are a set of plan views to illustrate a method of fabricating the mask assembly shown in FIG. 1;  \\n     [0017]FIGS. 6A and 6B are a set of cross sectional views to illustrate a method of fabricating the mask assembly shown in FIG. 3; and  \\n     [0018]FIGS. 7A to  7 D are a set of cross sectional views to illustrate a method of fabricating the mask assembly shown in FIG. 4. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n     [0019] A mask assembly according to various embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.  \\n     [0020] Referring to FIG. 1, a mask assembly  1  used for layer formation includes a rectangular frame  3  having a rectangular window  2 . The frame  3  is a rigid plate member made from, for instance, SUS430 (stainless steel). The frame  3  supports a masking portion  4  on the edge of the window  2 . The masking portion  4  is firmly attached to the frame  3  by means of adhesive or other connecting element (not shown). The masking portion  4  generally spans the window  2 .  \\n     [0021] The masking portion  4  includes a plurality of shielding (masking) parts  6 . Each shielding part  6  includes a plurality of parallel linear elements  5  arranged next to each other. The linear element  5  is a resin wire having a 10-micrometer diameter. It should be noted that three linear elements  5  form a single shielding part  6  in FIG. 1, but this is for the sake of easy illustration. In actuality, the shielding part  6  includes more linear elements  5 . Ends of the linear elements  5  are located on the edge of the window  2  of the frame  3 .  \\n     [0022] The shielding parts  6  are spaced from each other. The shielding parts  6  and the window  2  in combination define a plurality of rectangular openings  7 .  \\n     [0023] The mask assembly  1  is used for vapor deposition (layer formation). In a vapor deposition machine, the mask assembly  1  is placed such that the frame  3  faces a substrate across the masking portion  4 . A vapor deposition material is supplied from the frame side and passes through the openings  7  to reach the substrate. The material then becomes a thin layer having a certain pattern, which is determined by the openings  7 , on the substrate. Such vapor deposition process can make, for example, a bus line for organic electro luminescent elements and/or other parts.  \\n     [0024] It should be noted that the linear elements  5  may be stacked in the thickness direction of the frame  3  or mask assembly  1  (i.e., the direction perpendicular to the drawing sheet of FIG. 1) so that the masking part has a multi-layer structure. An example of a masking assembly having a multi-layer masking part is illustrated in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, the linear elements  5  ( 5 U,  5 L) of each shielding part  6 A have a two-layer structure. The lower layer is indicated as the \\u201cfirst layer\\u201d and the upper layer is indicated as the \\u201csecond layer.\\u201d The linear elements  5 L of the lower layer are directly placed on the frame  3 , and the linear elements  5 U of the upper layer are put on the lower linear elements  5 L. In FIG. 2, each lower linear element  5 L is located below the connecting line of two adjacent upper linear elements  5 U. Since each lower linear element  5 L seals a gap between the associated two upper linear elements  5 U, the vapor deposition material supplied, as indicated by the unshaded arrow, does not pass the gaps between the upper linear elements  5 U. The vapor deposition material flows through the openings  7  only. The multi-layer masking portion  4 A includes a plurality of multi-layer shielding parts  6 A to define the modified masking assembly  1 A.  \\n     [0025] Referring to FIG. 3, another masking assembly  1 B is illustrated. The masking assembly  1 B includes a plurality of modified shielding parts  6 B. Each shielding part  6 B includes a coating layer  8  that covers the linear elements  5 . The coating layer  8  seals a gap between each two adjacent linear elements  5 . Thus, the vapor deposition material (unshaded arrow) do not pass the gaps of the linear elements  5 . The resulting masking portion is designated at  4 B.  \\n     [0026] Instead of the coating layer  8 , a suitable film may be employed. As shown in FIG. 4, a film  9  may be attached over the linear elements  5  of each shielding part  6 C. The resulting masking portion is designated at  4 C, and the resulting masking assembly is designated at  1 C.  \\n     [0027] Now, a process of making the mask assembly will be described.  \\n     [0028] Firstly, referring to FIG. 5A, the frame  3  having the window  2  is prepared. Then, the linear elements  5  are provided on the frame  3  to completely close the window  2  as indicated at  4 \\u2032 in FIG. 5B.  \\n     [0029] The parallel linear elements  5  are arranged close to each other and firmly attached to the frame  3  by an adhesive or other suitable connector. Arranging and attaching the linear elements  5  may be performed simultaneously or successively. Alternatively, arranging a certain number of linear elements  5 , followed by the attaching process, may be repeated until the linear elements  5  close the entire window  2  of the frame  3 .  \\n     [0030] Tension is applied to the linear elements  5  when the linear elements  5  are attached to the frame  3 . Therefore, the linear elements  5  (or the mask portion  4 \\u2032) which span the window  2  do not bend or become loose.  \\n     [0031] After the mask portion  4 \\u2032 is fixed to the frame  3 , at least one linear element  5  is removed to form the opening(s)  7  as shown in FIG. 5C. The width of each opening  7  is determined by the number of the removed linear elements  5  and the diameter of each linear element. Accordingly, it is possible to arbitrarily determine the size (width) of each opening  7 . It is also possible to arbitrarily determine the location of each opening  7 .  \\n     [0032] If the linear elements  5  are stacked, the processes of FIGS. 5B and 5C are repeated. For example, when the mask shown in FIG. 2 is fabricated, the lower layer of linear elements  5 L are laid on the frame  3 , some of the lower linear elements  5 L are removed, and then the upper layer of linear elements  5 U are laid over the lower linear elements  5 L, and some of the upper linear elements  5 U are removed to form the openings  7 .  \\n     [0033] It should be noted that, as shown in FIG. 3, coating layers  8  may be provided over the linear elements  5  to seal gaps of adjacent linear elements  5 , before or after the process of FIG. 5C. The coating layers  8  may be formed by vapor-depositing a resin on the linear elements  5 . This will be described with reference to FIGS. 6A and 6B.  \\n     [0034] When the predetermined linear elements are removed and the openings  7  are formed as shown in FIG. 6A, the coating layers  8  are formed over the remaining linear elements  5  as shown in FIG. 6B. This is an example when the coating layers  8  are formed after the process of FIG. 5C.  \\n     [0035] Alternatively, if the coating layer formation is performed before the process of FIG. 5C (i.e., if the coating layers  8  are formed over all the linear elements  5 ), the coating layers  8  applied onto the unnecessary linear elements  5  are removed together with the unnecessary linear elements  5  when the unnecessary linear elements  5  are removed.  \\n     [0036] It should also be noted that, as shown in FIG. 4, films  9  may be provided over the linear elements  5  to seal gaps of adjacent linear elements  5 . The films  9  may be attached to the linear elements  5  by an adhesive. This will be described with reference to FIGS. 7A to  7 D.  \\n     [0037] First, the linear elements  5  are arranged side by side as shown in FIG. 7A. Then, the film  9  is applied to the linear elements  5  as shown in FIG. 7B. The film  9  is, for example, a metallic foil, and is attached to the linear elements  5  by a suitable adhesive.  \\n     [0038] Subsequently, the linear elements  5 , together with the film  9 , are firmly secured on the frame  3  as shown in FIG.  7 C. Then, predetermined linear elements  5  are removed to form the openings  7  as shown in FIG. 7D. When the unnecessary linear elements  5  are removed, the associated film is also removed. As a result, the mask  1 C is prepared.  \\n     [0039] It should be noted that the linear element  5  is circle in the cross sectional shape in the foregoing description, but the present invention is not limited in this regard. For instance, the linear element  5  may be polygonal in the cross sectional shape.  \\n     [0040] All the linear elements  5  may not be made from a single material. For example, if the linear elements  5  are categorized into \\u201cunnecessary\\u201d or \\u201cto be removed\\u201d elements and \\u201cnecessary\\u201d or \\u201cto remain \\u201d elements, the \\u201cto be removed\\u201d elements may be made from an acid-corrosive material and the \\u201cto remain\\u201d elements may be made from an acid-resistive material. The \\u201cto be removed\\u201d elements are those linear elements which are removed in the process of FIG. 5C to form the openings  7 . The frame  3  may also be made from the acid-resistive material. In this case, the process of FIG. 5C to remove the unnecessary linear elements can be performed by immersing all the linear elements together with the frame  3  (FIG. 5B) in an acid pool (not shown).  \\n     [0041] If the linear elements  5  and frame  3  deform upon heating, the linear elements  5  may be fused and fixed to the frame  3  by heating. In this case, no fixing agent such as an adhesive is needed to connect the linear elements  5  onto the frame  3 .  \\n     [0042] The shape and location of the window  2  and the shape of the frame  3  are not limited to those illustrated and described. For instance, the window  2  may have any suitable polygonal shape.  \\n     [0043] This application is based on a Japanese patent application No. 2003-15935, and the entire disclosure thereof is incorporated herein by reference.\"}, {\"publication_number\": \"US-2004168870-A1\", \"abstract_localized.text\": \"Suspension strut unit comprising a connector bearing for a piston rod of the suspension strut unit, where a spring plate for a vehicle spring has a bearing with a connector bearing-side bearing part and a spring plate-side bearing part, which bearing allows relative rotational movement between the vehicle spring and the connector bearing of the piston rod, where, after the piston rod has traveled inward a certain distance, a stop buffer rests against a cylinder; where a second bearing allows relative movement between the connector bearing and the cylinder after the stop buffer has become active; and where the second bearing allows the stop buffer to move relative to the spring plate at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the suspension strut unit.\", \"claims_localized.text\": \"What is claimed is:  \\n     \\n         1 .

Field of the Invention  \\n       [0002] The invention pertains to a suspension strut including unit a cylinder, a piston rod movable axially in the cylinder, a connector bearing fixed to the piston rod, a spring plate for supporting a vehicle spring, and a stop buffer for supporting the cylinder against the connector bearing to limit axial movement between the cylinder and the connector bearing. A first bearing permits relative rotation between the spring plate and the connector bearing, and a second bearing permits relative rotation between the connector bearing and the cylinder when the stopper buffer supports the connector bearing.  \\n       [0003] 2. Description of the Related Art  \\n       [0004] A suspension strut unit with a rotatable buffer support device is known from DE 83 11 927 U1. In addition to a bearing between a spring plate and a connecting element on the side facing the vehicle body, a second bearing is used, which compensates for relative movement between the connecting element and the cylinder of the suspension strut unit after the stop buffer has come to rest on the upper end surface of the cylinder. This bearing is a component of an end cap, which is pressed onto the cylinder. The two bearings make it possible for the connector bearing to be completely disconnected from the cylinder of the suspension strut unit. It is thus impossible for any twisting which could impair the comfort of the vehicle&#39;s occupants to occur between the connector bearing and the cylinder.  \\n       [0005] Although the end cap itself is comparatively simple in design, it nevertheless definitely represents an added cost.  \\n       [0006] To compensate for the transverse forces which act on the piston rod, the vehicle spring is frequently mounted at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the suspension strut unit. This means that the spring plate is also mounted at an angle. An angled spring plate which has its own bearing so that it can turn relative to the connector bearing executes a wobbling movement with respect to the end surface of the cylinder of the suspension strut unit. If a stop buffer is attached on the spring plate side, this buffer will then also wobble when the wheel is deflected, a deflection which the cylinder necessarily also performs synchronously. The radial deflection which the stop buffer executes depends very strongly on the maximum deflection angle of the wheel or of the cylinder and on the axial length of the stop buffer. If, for example, a very short stop buffer can be combined with a very large cylinder end surface, then the problem of the wobbling of the stop buffer will not occur at all under certain conditions. If the radial space available is very constricted, it is possible, for example, to attach the stop buffer to the cylinder. The stop buffer will then be disconnected from a spring plate-side component and will not execute any wobbling movements with respect to the end surface or the piston rod.  \\n       [0007] There are good reasons, however, for not attaching the stop buffer on the cylinder side. If the stop buffer were to be so attached, it would be absolutely necessary to provide it with a mounting cap. The cylinder should be as light as possible, however, because it is desirable to minimize the unsprung mass on the wheel side. Simply sliding the stop buffer over the piston rod without attaching it to the cylinder means that the stop buffer would be able to vibrate by itself in an uncontrolled manner. To prevent this, it would be necessary to center the stop buffer with a light press-fit on the piston rod, although this would increase the friction which occurs when the piston rod moves back and forth.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0008] The task of the present invention is to realize a suspension strut unit in which the problems associated with the attachment of the stop buffer known from the state of the art are solved.  \\n       [0009] According to the invention, the second bearing makes it possible for the stop buffer to move relative to the spring plate at an angle to the longitudinal axis.  \\n       [0010] The second bearing can thus compensate for the wobbling movement of the stop buffer even when the spring plate is mounted at an angle. The elastic volume of the stop buffer itself can be designed in the conventional manner.  \\n       [0011] In another advantageous embodiment, the output-side bearing part of the second bearing is in working connection with the spring plate-side bearing part of the first bearing. As a result, even when the cylinder and the active stop buffer perform deflecting movements, there is no relative movement in the circumferential direction between the cylinder and the stop buffer.  \\n       [0012] To simplify assembly, the output-side bearing part of the second bearing and the spring plate are designed as a single unit. This structural unit should be made of plastic where possible.  \\n       [0013] To stiffen the spring plate, the output-side bearing part of the second bearing is provided with reinforcement.  \\n       [0014] In a variant, the output-side bearing part of the second bearing has a receiving space for the stop buffer, where, between a bearing-side end surface of the stop buffer and the bottom of the receiving space, a free space is available for the stop buffer, and where a lateral surface of the stop buffer and a radial guide surface of the receiving space facing the lateral surface of the stop buffer allow the stop buffer to perform angular movements. The lateral surface and the guide surface are convex. The axial dimension of these lateral and guide surfaces can be limited to a disk-shaped area, because the angular movement of the stop buffer is also limited, and as a result the second bearing does not have to be very deep.  \\n       [0015] It is possible for the reinforcement material to form at least part of the receiving space.  \\n       [0016] In another advantageous embodiment, the output-side bearing part of the second bearing has a tension-lock connection with the stop buffer.  \\n       [0017] The tension-lock connection is formed by an expansion of the diameter of the stop buffer, which expanded area engages in at least one receptacle in the output-side bearing part of the second bearing.  \\n       [0018] The tension-lock connection on the output-side bearing part has a support surface, which supports the center of rotation for the angular movement of the stop buffer. The radii of the curved guide surface and of the lateral surface are thus determined by the distance between the center of rotation and the center axis of the suspension strut unit.  \\n       [0019] As an alternative, the output-side bearing part of the second bearing has a spheroidal bearing surface for an opposing bearing surface of the stop buffer. The stop buffer can be supported without any significant axial play on this bearing surface. Therefore, even when the cylinder is deflected, there will be no perceptible change in the spring characteristic of the stop buffer.  \\n       [0020] In another advantageous embodiment, the tension-lock connection for the stop buffer has a 3-dimensional shape concentric to the spheroidal bearing surface. The area of expanded diameter forms the opposing bearing surface of the stop buffer. The amount of axial space thus occupied is minimized, and a very simple 3-dimensional design is obtained for the output-side bearing part of the second bearing.  \\n       [0021] To simplify assembly, the radial dimension of the receptacle for the tension connection is greater than would be necessary for a defined angular movement of the stop buffer. During assembly, the stop buffer is introduced into the output-side bearing part of the second bearing in an extreme angular position, and when the buffer is pulled straight, the tension lock engages. The extreme angular position which the stop buffer assumes during assembly is never reached again in the fully assembled suspension strut unit.  \\n       [0022] According to an advantageous subclaim, the stop buffer has a pass-through opening for the piston rod, and the stop buffer also has a radial guide surface in the area of the pass-through opening, this surface resting against the piston rod. The guide surface itself is convex. When the cylinder performs a deflecting movement and the stop buffer performs its related angular movement, the stop buffer is supported on the piston rod, which always remains at the same angle to the cylinder. The piston rod now deflects the stop buffer in the second bearing in such a way that the center axis of the stop buffer becomes aligned, with a certain amount of play, with the center axis of the suspension strut unit.  \\n       [0023] By means of a third bearing, furthermore, the piston rod can be supported so that it can rotate with respect to the connector bearing. When the cylinder, during a deflecting movement, executes rotational movement relative to the connector bearing, the piston rod can rotate concomitantly in synchrony with the cylinder. It is assumed here that the friction between the cylinder and the piston rod (and the piston) is greater than the friction within the third bearing. As a result, no relative rotational movement can occur between the stop buffer and the piston rod either.  \\n       [0024] Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. It should be further understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0025]FIGS. 1-3 show a stop buffer capable of angled movement with respect to the spring plate; and  \\n     [0026]FIGS. 4-7 show a stop buffer with a spheroidal surface, which opposes a bearing surface.  \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0027]FIG. 1 shows part of a suspension strut unit  1  together with its connector bearing  3 . The suspension strut unit comprises a cylinder  5 , in which a piston rod  7  moves freely back and forth in the axial direction. The connector bearing has a ring-shaped base body  9  on the piston rod side, this body being enclosed on both axial sides and also radially on all sides by an elastomeric body  11 . A cup-shaped carrier body  13  provides reinforcement for the connector bearing and creates a chamber for the elastomeric body with a wall on one axial side and a wall radially around the outside. In addition, the carrier body has connecting means  15 , so that it can be attached to the body of the vehicle (not shown).  \\n     [0028] A second elastomeric body  17 , also provided with reinforcement, is supported on the outside of the carrier body  13 . The second elastomeric body carries a first bearing  19 , which is at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the suspension strut unit, where a connector bearing-side bearing output part  21  is supported on the second elastomeric body, and a spring plate  23  for the vehicle spring  25  forms a bearing input part. This first bearing ensures that the vehicle spring can rotate in the circumferential direction relative to the connector bearing and thus also to the piston rod.  \\n     [0029] Concentric to the piston rod, a stop buffer  27  is fastened to the connector bearing  3 . After the piston rod has traveled inward a certain distance relative to the cylinder, the stop buffer  27  comes to rest against an end surface  29  of the cylinder, or, in this case, against the end surface of a cylinder cap. To prevent the stop buffer from twisting in the circumferential direction, this component is in working connection with the bearing input part of the first bearing  19 , i.e., the spring plate  23 , by way of a second bearing  31 . In concrete terms, an output part of the second bearing is in this case designed as an integral part of the spring plate  23 . As a result, there is no relative movement in the circumferential direction between the cylinder  5 , the stop buffer  27 , the spring plate  23 , and the vehicle spring  25 .  \\n     [0030] As its output-side bearing part for the second bearing  31 , the spring plate  23  has a cup-shaped base body  33  with a central pass-through opening for the piston rod  7 . The base body  33  has a receiving space  35  for the stop buffer  27 , and free space is available for the stop buffer between the end surface  27   s  of the stop buffer and the bottom  37  of the receiving space  35 . The stop buffer has a lateral surface  39 , which is supported with the freedom to slide along a guide surface  41  of the receiving space. The stop buffer can thus move relative to the spring plate at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the suspension strut unit.  \\n     [0031] The output-side bearing part  33  of the second bearing  31  has a tension-lock connection  43  with the stop buffer  27 . The tension-lock connection  43  is formed by an expansion  45  of the diameter of the stop buffer  27 , which expansion engages in a receptacle. In this case, the receptacle is the receiving space  35  in the second bearing  31 . The output-side bearing part has a support surface  47 , which supports the center of rotation for the angular movement of the stop buffer relative to the output-side bearing part. The lateral surface and the guide surface have rounded contours, the radii of which are approximately the same as the diameter at the transition between the guide surface  41  and the support surface  47 .  \\n     [0032] In FIG. 2 it can be seen that, when the cylinder  5  is deflected, the angular position of the cup-shaped base body  33  changes as a result of the slanted orientation of the first bearing  19 . In practice, the cup-shaped base body  33  executes a wobbling movement. The stop buffer  27  is drawn in thin line to show how, if it were rigidly connected to the cup-shaped base body, it, too, would wobble in synchrony with the wobbling of the cup-shaped base body. The second bearing  31 , however, makes it possible for the stop buffer to execute angular movements with respect to the spring plate  23 , during which the end of the stop buffer pointing toward the cylinder  5  is supported on the piston rod  7 . The stop buffer thus assumes the position shown in thick line inside the receiving space  35 , where it takes advantage of the free space. When the inward travel of the piston rod is superimposed on the angular movement, the stop buffer will be supported against the bottom  37  of the receiving space  35 .  \\n     [0033]FIG. 3 shows a design which is functionally the same as the design according to FIG. 1. The difference is that the output-side bearing part  33  of the second bearing  31  now has a reinforcing element  49 , which also determines the contour of the receiving space  35 . Considerable forces are introduced into the base body  33  when the stop buffer goes into action. The reinforcement makes it possible for the base body to absorb a greater amount of force than it could if it were made of plastic alone. In addition, the pretension of a protective bellows  51  also acts on the base body  33 .  \\n     [0034] In the second design variant, shown in FIG. 4, the output side bearing part, called the base body  33  in the following, has a spheroidal bearing surface  53  for an opposing bearing surface  55  on the stop buffer  27 . The bearing surface is convex in the direction away from the first bearing  19 . The optimum center point for the bearing surface is at the intersection of the plane of the first bearing with the longitudinal axis of the suspension strut unit. The tension-lock connection  43  for the stop buffer has a 3-dimensional shape which is concentric to the bearing surface. In the area of a pass-through opening  57  for the piston rod, the stop buffer has a radial guide surface  59 , which rests against the piston rod.  \\n     [0035] During deflecting movements of the cylinder  5 , the base body  33  executes wobbling movements because of the angled position of the first bearing  19  relative to the piston rod  7 . The stop buffer is supported by its guide surface  59  on the piston rod. The concave bearing surface  55  of the stop buffer slides on the convex bearing surface  53  of the base body, and the stop buffer thus executes angular movements, which compensate for the wobbling. Regardless of the angular position of the stop buffer relative to the base body, there is always a large contact area between the bearing surface of the base body and the opposing bearing surface of the stop buffer.  \\n     [0036]FIG. 5 shows the angular position of the stop buffer  27  of FIG. 4 in the base body  33  during the assembly procedure. The radial dimensions of the bearing surface  53  and of a receptacle  61  for the tension-lock connection of the stop buffer are larger than would be necessary for a defined maximum angular movement of the stop buffer. As a result, the tension connection between the stop buffer and the base body can be established more easily by moving the stop buffer to this extreme angle. The stop buffer never reaches this angular position again after the suspension strut unit has been installed in the chassis. As additional assembly-facilitating measures, the base body is designed with a conically tapered feed surface  63  leading to the support surface  47  of the tension-lock connection, and the transition from the feed surface to the support surface of the tension connection is provided with a transition radius.  \\n     [0037] In FIG. 6, a third bearing  65  is used in addition to the first bearing  19  for the vehicle spring  25  and the second bearing  31  for the stop buffer  27 ; this third bearing makes it possible for the piston rod  7  to rotate relative to the connector bearing  3 . This third bearing is located spatially between the ring-shaped base body  9  and a shoulder on the piston rod and thus is functionally separate from the second bearing  31 , because neither the bearing input part nor the bearing output part of the second bearing is connected to the piston rod or to the base body  9 .  \\n     [0038] The third bearing  65  is also designed as a slide bearing here by way of example. A slide element  67  is located between a bearing disk  69  and a bearing cup  71 . Alternatively, a roller bearing could also be used at this point.  \\n     [0039] The third bearing  65  acts to prevent relative movement between the stop buffer  27  and the piston rod. Overall, thanks to the third bearing, the connector bearing is completely disconnected in the circumferential direction from the spring plate  23 , from the cylinder  5 , and from the stop buffer  27 . Thus the angular movement of the stop buffer cannot cause any frictional forces to act in the circumferential direction between the guide surface  59  of the stop buffer and the piston rod  7 .  \\n     [0040]FIG. 7 is intended to show that the direction of the curvature of the spheroidal bearing surface and the opposing bearing surface of the second bearing  31  can also have a radius of curvature oriented in the direction opposite the one shown in FIGS. 4-6. The absolute value of the radius of curvature is determined by the amount of construction space available, by the length of the stop buffer  27 , and especially by the maximum deflection angle which can occur, but also by the angle of the first bearing  19  to the longitudinal axis of the suspension strut unit  1 . Otherwise, this variant functions in exactly the same way as the variant according to FIGS. 4 and 5, the expert being free to use the third bearing according to FIG. 6 or not.  \\n     [0041] Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the devices illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Moreover, it should be recognized that structures and/or elements and/or method steps shown and/or described in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice.
